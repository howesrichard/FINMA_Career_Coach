== Notes on Taxonomy

=== Cross-Cutting Functions
Many institutions have similar support functions:
- *Risk Management* (market, credit, operational, liquidity)
- *Compliance & Legal* (regulatory, AML/KYC, licensing)
- *Finance & Treasury* (funding, capital management, financial reporting)
- *Human Resources* (recruitment, learning & development, culture)
- *Technology & Operations* (systems, data, cybersecurity, process automation)
- *Strategy & Corporate Development* (strategic planning, M&A, partnerships)

=== Key Differentiators for Fund Managers
- *Asset Class Focus*: Equity vs Fixed Income vs Alternatives (Infrastructure, RE, PE, Commodities)
- *Investment Style*: Value vs Growth vs Quantitative vs Thematic
- *Manager Type*: Long-Only vs Hedge Fund vs Private Markets
- *Client Type*: Institutional vs Retail vs UHNW

=== Competition Across Institution Types
Despite appearing in different categories, many institutions compete directly for the same business:

*Corporate Advisory & M&A:*
- Boutique corporate advisory firms (Barrenjoey, Lazard, Greenhill) compete with investment banking divisions of institutional banks (Macquarie, UBS, Goldman Sachs)
- Full-service brokers with corporate advisory divisions (Morgans) compete with both boutiques and bank investment banking teams
- Accounting firms' transaction services teams (Big Four) compete on smaller deals and financial due diligence
- Management consultancies (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) compete on strategic aspects of M&A

*Lending & Credit:*
- Non-bank lenders (Pepper Money, Liberty Financial) compete directly with retail banks for mortgages and consumer loans, particularly in non-conforming segments
- Private credit funds compete with institutional banks' lending divisions for corporate and commercial real estate financing
- Non-bank lenders often compete on speed, flexibility, and willingness to lend to higher-risk borrowers that banks decline

*Investment Management:*
- Large superannuation funds' in-house investment teams compete with external fund managers for direct investment opportunities (particularly in private markets)
- Platform providers compete with fund managers by offering model portfolios and managed accounts
- Insurance companies' investment divisions compete with fund managers for fixed income and alternative assets

*Wealth & Advisory:*
- Financial adviser networks compete with retail banks' wealth divisions for high-net-worth clients
- Platform providers compete with both retail banks and superannuation funds for investment administration
- Research houses compete with fund managers' internal research and brokers' research divisions

*Research & Ratings:*
- Brokers' equity research competes with independent research houses (Morningstar, Lonsec) for influence over investment decisions
- Asset consultants' manager research competes with research houses and superannuation funds' internal due diligence teams

*Insurance Distribution:*
- Insurance brokers compete with banks' bancassurance divisions and direct insurers for premium volume
- Financial advisers compete with both brokers and direct channels for life insurance placement

*Economic & Strategy Advisory:*
- Economics consultancies (Frontier, Endgame) compete with institutional banks' research divisions and central bank/Treasury for expert testimony and policy advice
- Management consultancies compete with boutique advisors and internal strategy teams on corporate strategy projects

*Market Making & Trading:*
- Proprietary trading firms (Optiver, IMC, Tibra/Chimera) compete with institutional banks' sales & trading divisions for market making flow and provide liquidity on exchanges
- HFT firms compete with traditional brokers in providing execution services and narrow spreads
- Systematic prop trading firms compete with quantitative hedge funds for talent and alpha generation
- Prop trading firms often provide better pricing/execution than banks for retail brokers and institutional clients due to lower capital costs and technology advantages

=== Australian Context
- Retail banks heavily focused on mortgages (60%+ of lending)
- Superannuation funds have large direct investment capabilities (especially large industry funds)
- Non-bank lenders rely heavily on securitisation and warehouse funding
- Strong regulatory oversight from APRA, ASIC, RBA drives significant compliance functions across all institutions
- *Corporate Advisory often exists in firms that are not regulated banks* (i.e., they do not have an ADI license). Boutique advisory firms like Barrenjoey, Lazard, and Greenhill provide M&A and capital markets advisory without taking deposits or engaging in traditional banking activities. Full-service brokers like Morgans also provide corporate advisory services without ADI licenses.
- *Proprietary trading firms operate with lighter regulatory burden than banks* (not ADIs, generally not managing client money), but must comply with ASIC Market Integrity Rules and market conduct regulations. Many Australian prop trading firms have emerged from or maintain links to institutional bank trading desks (e.g., Epoch's heritage from Merrill Lynch, Tibra traders founding Chimera).
