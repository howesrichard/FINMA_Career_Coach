== Overview: What Does an Insurance Company Actuary Do?

Actuaries in insurance companies apply mathematical models and statistical analysis to assess insurance risk, price products, establish reserves for future claims, and ensure the company maintains adequate capital to meet its obligations. They work primarily within the Actuarial division of general and life insurance companies, though they also support other areas including underwriting, product development, and strategic planning.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *Actuarial Consultant*: Consultants (at firms like Mercer, Willis Towers Watson, Deloitte) provide actuarial advice to multiple clients across various projects. Insurance company actuaries work for a single insurer and focus deeply on that company's specific portfolio and risks.
- *Reinsurance Actuary*: Reinsurers assume risk from primary insurers and focus on large loss modelling, catastrophe risk, and treaty design. Direct insurance actuaries price retail products and manage day-to-day reserving for their insurer's direct book.
- *Data Scientist/Quantitative Analyst*: These roles focus on predictive analytics and machine learning across various industries. Actuaries apply specific statistical methods to insurance problems with heavy regulatory requirements and professional standards.
- *Risk Manager*: Risk managers identify and mitigate operational and strategic risks across the business. Actuaries specifically quantify insurance risk (frequency and severity of claims) and ensure adequate pricing and capital.
- *Underwriter*: Underwriters make risk acceptance decisions on individual policies. Actuaries provide the statistical foundation and pricing models that underwriters use.

*Core Responsibilities of Insurance Actuaries:*

1. *Pricing*: Developing premium rates for insurance products based on expected claims costs, expenses, and profit margins
2. *Reserving*: Estimating liabilities for unpaid claims (both reported and incurred but not yet reported)
3. *Product Development*: Designing new insurance products and features with appropriate risk-based pricing
4. *Capital Modelling*: Assessing required capital under APRA prudential standards and internal risk appetite
5. *Experience Analysis*: Monitoring actual vs expected claims experience and adjusting assumptions
6. *Reinsurance Optimization*: Modelling optimal reinsurance structures to transfer risk efficiently
7. *Regulatory Compliance*: Preparing actuarial reports for APRA, valuing technical provisions, ensuring regulatory compliance
8. *Strategic Analysis*: Supporting business strategy with quantitative insights on portfolio performance, market opportunities, and risk/return trade-offs

*Work Environment:*

Insurance actuaries typically work within dedicated actuarial teams but collaborate extensively with underwriting, claims, finance, and senior management. Work is a mix of technical analysis (modelling in Excel, R, Python, specialized actuarial software), stakeholder communication, and regulatory reporting. The actuarial profession in Australia is structured around progression through the Actuaries Institute qualification pathway.

=== A Day in the Life: Actuarial Graduate, General Insurance Company (Sydney)

*8:30am - 9:00am*: Arrive at office. Check emails - claims team sent updated motor claims data for Q3 pricing review. Download to secure folder. Review today's priorities:
- Complete home insurance pricing analysis for NSW bushfire-prone areas (due Friday for pricing committee)
- Continue motor insurance reserving analysis for quarterly board report
- Attend 2pm pricing committee meeting
- Study session tonight for Part II exam (Financial Mathematics) next month

*9:00am - 9:15am*: Morning stand-up with actuarial pricing team (5 people). Each person shares:
- You: Working on bushfire pricing, motor reserves, studying tonight
- Senior analyst: Finalizing commercial property pricing refresh for underwriting
- Another graduate: Building new pricing segmentation model for young driver risk
- Manager: Meeting with CFO on reserve adequacy, preparing APRA submission
- Agreed priorities, note any blockers (you need clarification on treatment of reinsurance recoveries in bushfire modelling - manager will help after stand-up)

*9:15am - 9:30am*: Quick chat with manager about reinsurance treatment. She explains: \"For bushfire-exposed properties, we have catastrophe reinsurance that covers losses above \$50m. In your pricing, you need to model gross loss cost first, then apply reinsurance recoveries. The net loss cost (after reinsurance) determines our required premium. I'll send you last year's catastrophe model outputs to use as template.\"

*9:30am - 11:30am*: Deep analytical work on bushfire pricing. Working in R:
- Extract 5 years of home insurance claims data for NSW
- Filter to properties in bushfire-prone postcodes (using RFS bushfire prone land mapping)
- Calculate average claim frequency (claims per 100 policies per year) = 2.3% for bushfire areas vs 0.8% for non-bushfire
- Calculate average claim severity (cost per claim when it occurs) = \$185,000 for bushfire areas vs \$45,000 for non-bushfire
- Build statistical model using GLM (Generalized Linear Model) to predict claim frequency and severity by:
  - Proximity to bushland (within 100m, 100-500m, 500m+)
  - Property characteristics (construction type, defensible space, sprinkler systems)
  - Fire danger rating of location (extreme, severe, high, moderate)

Results show clear risk gradients: Properties within 100m of bushland in extreme fire danger areas have 5.2% annual claim frequency vs 0.8% for properties 500m+ away in moderate zones.

Calculate required premium rates incorporating:
- Expected claims cost (frequency × severity)
- Expenses (commission, admin, underwriting costs = 25% of premium)
- Profit loading (10% margin)
- Reinsurance costs (we pay 8% of premium for catastrophe coverage)

*Example calculation for highest risk tier:*
- Frequency: 5.2% | Severity: \$185,000 | Expected claims = 5.2% × \$185,000 = \$9,620
- Expenses: \$9,620 ÷ 75% × 25% = \$3,207 (25% of premium)
- Premium before profit: \$9,620 + \$3,207 = \$12,827
- Plus profit margin (10%): \$12,827 ÷ 90% = \$14,252
- Plus reinsurance cost: \$14,252 ÷ 92% = \$15,491 *annual premium*

Complete rate table showing premiums for all risk tiers. Create visualization showing how premium varies by bushfire risk factors.

*11:30am - 12:00pm*: Email draft analysis to senior analyst for peer review. Highlight key findings:
- Proposed premium increases for highest-risk properties (currently underpriced by ~40%)
- Recommendation to restrict new business in certain extreme-risk postcodes
- Suggestion for risk mitigation discounts (sprinkler systems, fire-resistant construction)

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch at desk while reviewing study notes for Part II exam. Today's topic: bond mathematics and immunization strategies. Tough material but relevant to insurance company investment portfolio management.

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Shift to motor insurance reserving work. Open Excel model for outstanding claims liabilities. Using Chain Ladder method:
- Extract paid claims triangles (showing how claims paid develop over time since accident date)
- Extract incurred claims triangles (showing reported claims amounts)
- Calculate age-to-age development factors showing how claims "develop" as more information emerges
- Apply development patterns to recent accident periods to estimate ultimate claims cost
- Calculate reserve = Ultimate claims - Already paid claims

Notice concerning pattern: Recent accident quarters showing higher-than-expected severity (cost per claim up 12% vs prior year). Flag this for discussion - could be inflation in vehicle repair costs, increase in total loss claims, or change in injury settlement patterns. Need to investigate further and possibly increase reserve estimate.

Update working papers with preliminary reserve estimate. Calculate change vs prior quarter. Significant increase needed (+\$15m) - this will impact company's reported profitability and capital position. Document reasoning clearly for management review.

*2:00pm - 3:30pm*: Pricing Committee meeting (attending with manager and senior actuary). Committee includes Chief Actuary, Chief Underwriting Officer, Product Manager, CFO, and two Board directors.

*Agenda Item 1*: Motor insurance rate change proposal (presented by senior actuary)
- Recommendation: +4.5% average rate increase driven by claims cost inflation
- Competitive analysis shows this keeps us middle of market
- Discussion: CFO concerned about impact on policy retention. CUO suggests targeted increases (higher for high-risk segments, minimal for preferred customers)
- Decision: Approve +4.5% average but with differential implementation by segment

*Agenda Item 2*: New cyber insurance product launch (presented by Product Manager)
- Target market: SME businesses
- Coverage: Data breach costs, business interruption, cyber extortion
- Actuarial view (Chief Actuary presents): Limited claims data available for this emerging risk, conservative pricing recommended with aggregate limits to cap exposure
- You're taking detailed notes - this is great learning on new product development
- Decision: Approve pilot launch with \$20m aggregate limit, review after 6 months

*Agenda Item 3*: Reinsurance renewal strategy for upcoming year
- Discussion of catastrophe reinsurance structure (retention level, limit, cost)
- Capital modelling showing optimal retention at \$50m vs \$100m
- Board director asks probing questions about climate change impact on catastrophe frequency
- Decision: Maintain current structure, commission climate scenario analysis

*3:30pm - 4:30pm*: Follow up on motor reserving analysis. Senior actuary reviewed your work and has feedback via email:
- \"Good work on the analysis. The severity trend is real - I've seen similar patterns in industry data. Can you investigate further by claim type? Break down bodily injury vs property damage to see where the increase is coming from. Also check if there's regional variation - could be specific to certain states.\"

Dive deeper into data:
- Property damage severity up 8% (likely vehicle repair costs, parts shortages post-pandemic)
- Bodily injury severity up 18% (concerning - potential increase in legal settlements, more expensive medical treatment, longer recovery times)
- NSW and VIC showing higher increases than QLD and WA

Draft email to senior actuary with findings. Recommend:
1. Increase bodily injury reserve assumptions by 15% for recent accident years
2. Monitor closely over next two quarters - if trend continues, will need pricing action
3. Consider adjusting settlement practices to manage bodily injury claims more proactively

*4:30pm - 5:15pm*: Peer review session with other actuarial graduate. She's working on commercial property pricing and wants feedback on her model approach. Review her work:
- Methodology looks sound (using frequency-severity approach)
- Notice she hasn't adjusted for large losses in tail - suggest using percentile capping to avoid distortion from single catastrophic claim
- Discuss how she's handling seasonal patterns (bushfire risk varies by quarter)

*5:15pm - 5:45pm*: Administrative tasks and catching up:
- Complete timesheet allocation (60% pricing project, 30% reserving, 10% training/study)
- Review tomorrow's calendar - 9am meeting with underwriting to discuss bushfire pricing findings
- Update project tracker for bushfire pricing analysis - now 85% complete, on track for Friday deadline
- Quick check of actuarial forums and industry news - ICA (Insurance Council of Australia) released new climate risk report, download to read tonight

*5:45pm - 6:00pm*: Wrap up and head home. Save all work, back up model files to secure shared drive. Check emails one final time - nothing urgent.

*Evening (7:00pm - 9:00pm)*: Study session for Part II exam at home. Tonight's focus: stochastic interest rate models (Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross). Work through practice problems on bond pricing and duration matching. Part II exam in 4 weeks - need to maintain consistent study routine (2 hours most weeknights, 4-5 hours weekend days). Balancing full-time work with professional studies is challenging but essential for career progression.

*Weekend*: Generally free from work, though during quarter-end reporting periods (March, June, September, December) may need to work some weekend hours to complete regulatory filings. Weekend primarily for exam study - typically 8-10 hours total across Saturday and Sunday when exam is approaching.
