= Actuary Roles at Reinsurance Companies

== Overview

Actuaries at reinsurance companies are the mathematical and analytical backbone of the organization, responsible for pricing complex risk transfers, modeling catastrophic events, managing capital requirements, and ensuring the firm's financial stability. Unlike actuaries at primary insurers who assess individual policyholder risks, reinsurance actuaries work with aggregated portfolios, evaluate accumulation risk across geographies and perils, and manage tail risk from low-frequency, high-severity events.

In Australia, major global reinsurers operate through local offices including Swiss Re Australia, Munich Re Australia, Hannover Re, and SCOR. These firms provide reinsurance coverage across life, health, property, and casualty lines, supporting Australian primary insurers with risk transfer, capital relief, and technical expertise.

Reinsurance actuarial work requires sophisticated modeling capabilities, deep understanding of insurance markets, and the ability to assess risks that may not have extensive historical data (such as cyber risk, climate change impacts, or pandemic risk). Actuaries must balance technical precision with commercial judgment, working closely with underwriters, claims teams, and clients (cedants - the primary insurers ceding risk).

This document outlines actuary roles at reinsurance companies, from entry-level graduate positions through to Chief Actuary, covering both Life & Health and Property & Casualty (P&C) reinsurance disciplines.

=== A Day in the Life

*7:30am - 8:30am*: Early start to prepare for pricing meeting on Property Catastrophe XL treaty renewal. You're supporting the senior actuary pricing this treaty for a major Australian general insurer. The treaty protects the cedant against losses from events like cyclones, bushfires, floods exceeding AU\$50 million retention. Review your analysis from yesterday: examined the cedant's exposure data (property values, locations, construction types across Australia), ran exposure through Swiss Re's CatNet catastrophe model, calculated pure premium (expected annual losses from modeled events), added risk margin and expense loadings.

Key finding: exposure has grown 15% year-over-year due to property value inflation and portfolio growth. Bushfire risk in peri-urban areas (especially Blue Mountains, Adelaide Hills, outer Perth) has increased significantly - climate change driving higher fire danger days. Cyclone risk relatively stable but Tropical Cyclone Jasper (February 2024) caused AU\$85 million in insured losses industry-wide, reminder of tail risk. Your catastrophe model runs suggest pure premium should be AU\$12.5 million (vs AU\$10.8 million last year), indicating ~15% rate increase needed to maintain risk-adjusted return.

*8:30am - 9:30am*: Pricing meeting with underwriting team. Senior actuary (your manager) leads discussion, you present technical analysis. Walk through: 1) Exposure growth drivers, 2) Loss cost trends (claims inflation running at 8-10% for property), 3) Catastrophe modeling results (1-in-100 year loss estimate increased from AU\$220 million to AU\$255 million), 4) Pricing recommendation (AU\$16.2 million premium, up from AU\$14.0 million - includes profit margin and cost of capital).

Underwriter raises concern: "This is a 16% rate increase. Market is competitive, cedant will push back hard." Senior actuary responds: "We're seeing consistent upward pressure on cat risk - climate change, coastal development, property inflation. If we don't achieve adequate rate, we should consider reducing limit or increasing retention." You add supporting data: "Industry cat bond market is pricing Australian cyclone risk at ROL of 8-12%, our pricing is consistent with that benchmark." Discussion continues - agree to pitch AU\$16.2 million as opening position, willing to negotiate to AU\$15.5 million minimum but would require tighter terms (e.g., seasonal aggregates, co-participation clause).

*9:30am - 10:30am*: Back at desk, shift to different project - quarterly experience analysis on Life Reinsurance portfolio. Your firm provides mortality and morbidity reinsurance to Australian life insurers. Review actual claims experience vs. expected for Q3 2024: mortality experience slightly favorable (A/E ratio 92% - fewer death claims than expected based on pricing assumptions), but TPD (Total & Permanent Disability) claims significantly adverse (A/E ratio 118%).

Dig into TPD claims detail: concentration in mental health claims (stress, anxiety, depression) particularly in younger ages (30-45). This is concerning trend - mental health claims have become more prevalent post-COVID, and these claims tend to be longer duration and more expensive. Flag for senior actuary: may need to strengthen TPD pricing assumptions, particularly for white-collar occupations where mental health claims more common. Draft memo summarizing findings.

*10:30am - 11:00am*: Coffee break while reading Swiss Re's latest sigma research report on natural catastrophes. Report highlights that 2024 global insured losses from nat cats reached USD \$108 billion, above 10-year average. Key drivers: increased severe convective storm (SCS) losses in US, European flooding, Australian east coast floods early in year. Report discusses attribution science linking climate change to increased frequency/severity of certain perils. Take notes on key statistics for use in client presentations - this validates the rate increases you're pushing for on cat treaties.

*11:00am - 12:00pm*: Work on building pricing model for new cyber reinsurance treaty. This is emerging class of business for your firm. Cedant is an Australian general insurer writing cyber insurance for SMEs and corporates. Challenge: limited historical claims data, fast-evolving risk landscape (ransomware, business interruption from cyber events, regulatory changes like Privacy Act amendments and APRA's CPS 234 on information security).

Approach: build frequency-severity model using industry benchmarks (CRO Forum data, Lloyd's cyber research), adjust for Australian market characteristics (smaller average company size vs US, different legal/regulatory environment), incorporate scenario analysis for large accumulation events (e.g., cloud provider outage affecting multiple insureds simultaneously). Initial model suggests high uncertainty - coefficients of variation >50%. Will need to build in substantial risk margins and discuss risk appetite with underwriters carefully.

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch with fellow graduate actuaries (three others in your cohort). Discussion about Part II exam results (released this week) - one colleague passed two subjects, advancing toward Fellowship. Share study tips and commiserate about balancing work with exam preparation. Also discuss career paths - someone from previous graduate cohort just left to join a primary insurer as pricing actuary, another moved to consulting. You're enjoying reinsurance - like the portfolio-level analysis and exposure to global cat risks - plan to continue toward Fellowship here.

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Client call with cedant (Australian mid-tier life insurer) to discuss experience review on Individual Disability Income (IDI) reinsurance treaty. Senior actuary leads call, you present technical analysis. Show actual vs expected analysis by: age band, occupation class, benefit period, waiting period. Key finding: claims experience deteriorated on short waiting period policies (30-day and 60-day) - claim incidence up 22% vs pricing assumptions.

Cedant claims manager explains: underwriting was loosened 18 months ago to grow volumes, distribution shifted toward financial advisor channel where underwriting rigor sometimes weaker. Your firm's treaty is quota share (proportional reinsurance sharing 50% of premiums and claims), so you're directly exposed to this adverse selection. Senior actuary proposes: adjust pricing to reflect new experience (+35% rate increase on short waiting period classes), or alternatively, reduce quota share participation to 30% and let cedant retain more of this problematic business. Cedant to consider options, respond in two weeks.

*2:00pm - 3:00pm*: Attend training session on IFRS 17 implementation. IFRS 17 is new accounting standard for insurance contracts (effective January 2023 in Australia). Significantly changes how reinsurance assets and liabilities are measured and reported. Finance team presenting on practical implications for reserving actuaries. Key changes: 1) Contracts measured using present value of future cash flows plus risk adjustment and contractual service margin (CSM), 2) Changes in assumptions flow through P&L differently than under previous standards, 3) Extensive new disclosure requirements.

Take detailed notes - this will impact how you value reinsurance treaties going forward. Ask question about risk adjustment methodology (confidence level vs cost of capital approach) - presenter explains firm is using 75th percentile cost of capital method, aligned with Australian market practice. Good learning - IFRS 17 is complex but crucial for financial reporting.

*3:00pm - 4:30pm*: Deep work session on catastrophe modeling for Property Cat treaty discussed this morning. Senior actuary asked you to run sensitivity analysis on key modeling assumptions: 1) What if climate change leads to 10% increase in cyclone frequency? 2) What if bushfire losses increase 20% due to more extreme fire weather? 3) What if earthquake risk in Eastern Australia higher than currently modeled (recent research suggests Sydney/Melbourne seismic risk may be underestimated)?

Run additional model scenarios in CatNet. Results:
- 10% cyclone frequency increase → pure premium up 8% to AU\$13.5 million
- 20% bushfire severity increase → pure premium up 12% to AU\$14.0 million
- Enhanced earthquake assumptions → pure premium up 6% to AU\$13.2 million
- Combined worst-case scenario → pure premium up 28% to AU\$16.0 million

This demonstrates pricing sensitivity to modeling assumptions. Document findings in memo for senior actuary, including recommendation: given uncertainty around climate trends, should maintain pricing discipline and build in conservatism. Better to lose treaty at inadequate rate than underprice catastrophic risk.

*4:30pm - 5:00pm*: Review draft pricing memo for Medical Malpractice treaty renewal (you're supporting senior actuary on this). Treaty provides excess of loss coverage for medical indemnity insurer. Memo looks technically sound but you notice assumption about claims development pattern looks optimistic - medical malpractice claims often take 5-10 years to fully develop (litigation, settlement negotiations), but memo assumes 70% of ultimate claims paid within 3 years. Flag concern to senior actuary via email with supporting data from industry loss development studies. She responds: "Good catch - please revise memo with more conservative development pattern, this will increase pricing."

*5:00pm - 6:00pm*: Study for actuarial exam - you're writing Subject CM2 (Financial Engineering and Loss Reserving) in November, two months away. Today focus on chain ladder reserving technique, working through practice problems. Topic directly relevant to your day job (developing IBNR reserves for reinsurance treaties), which helps exam preparation. Calculate that need ~15-20 hours of study per week to be prepared for exam. Balance with full-time work is challenging but manageable.

*Evening*: Leave office around 6:00pm most days. Tonight taking home reading - Munich Re publication on nat cat trends in Asia-Pacific, relevant to understanding Australian catastrophe exposure. Also review technical paper from Actuaries Institute on climate change impact on Australian insurance, useful for understanding emerging risks your firm underwrites.

== Conclusion

Actuary roles at reinsurance companies offer intellectually challenging careers combining rigorous mathematical analysis with business judgment, risk assessment, and strategic thinking. Unlike primary insurance actuaries who focus on individual policyholders or specific portfolios, reinsurance actuaries work at a higher level of aggregation, assessing accumulation risk, modeling low-frequency catastrophic events, and managing capital across diverse exposures.

The Australian reinsurance market, while smaller than global hubs like Bermuda or London, provides excellent opportunities for actuaries to develop expertise across life, health, and property & casualty reinsurance. Major global reinsurers maintain significant operations in Australia, offering actuaries exposure to sophisticated modeling techniques, international risk portfolios, and cutting-edge risk management practices.

Success in reinsurance actuarial roles requires strong technical skills (statistics, modeling, programming) combined with business acumen, communication abilities, and professional judgment. Actuaries must balance theoretical rigor with commercial pragmatism, understanding that perfect models are impossible but sound approximations combined with appropriate margins can effectively manage risk.

For university students considering this career path, strong quantitative foundations (mathematics, statistics, data science) are essential. Actuarial qualification through the Actuaries Institute is the standard pathway, though some catastrophe modelers come from engineering or earth science backgrounds. Internships at reinsurers, primary insurers, or actuarial consulting firms provide valuable exposure to the field.

Career progression from Graduate Actuary to Chief Actuary typically spans 15-20 years, with opportunities to specialize (catastrophe modeling, capital management, climate risk) or maintain generalist expertise across pricing, reserving, and risk management. The skills developed—sophisticated quantitative analysis, risk assessment, communication of complex concepts, and strategic thinking—are highly transferable across financial services and beyond.

The field is dynamic and evolving, with emerging challenges around climate change, cyber risk, pandemic risk, and social inflation requiring actuaries to continuously update their skills and methodologies. For those who enjoy combining mathematics with real-world problem-solving, navigating uncertainty, and contributing to financial stability, reinsurance actuarial careers offer deeply rewarding opportunities.

The most successful reinsurance actuaries combine technical excellence with curiosity about the world (understanding weather patterns, building construction, legal systems, medical trends), humility about model limitations, and commitment to continuous learning. As risks evolve and become more complex, the role of actuaries in quantifying, pricing, and managing these risks becomes increasingly critical to the financial system's resilience.
