= Infrastructure Due Diligence Analyst Role

== Private Markets (Infrastructure) Manager - Investment Team

== Overview

Infrastructure Due Diligence Analysts at private markets managers play a critical role in evaluating potential infrastructure investments, conducting rigorous financial, commercial, and technical analysis to inform investment decisions. Unlike equity research analysts who assess publicly traded companies, infrastructure analysts evaluate long-lived physical assets (airports, toll roads, energy infrastructure, utilities, digital infrastructure) with complex regulatory frameworks, contracted cash flows, and 20-50+ year investment horizons.

In Australia, major infrastructure investors include IFM Investors, AustralianSuper (Direct Infrastructure team), QIC, First Sentier Investors, and international managers like Macquarie Asset Management, Brookfield, and AMP Capital (now Dexus). These firms deploy capital across core infrastructure (stable, regulated assets like energy networks and water utilities), core-plus infrastructure (moderate growth assets like airports and toll roads), and value-add infrastructure (higher-risk development or operational turnaround opportunities).

Infrastructure due diligence requires a unique skill set combining financial modeling, engineering/technical understanding, regulatory analysis, and commercial judgment. Analysts must assess traffic forecasts, energy demand projections, regulatory reset methodologies, competitive dynamics, and ESG considerations while building sophisticated discounted cash flow models spanning decades.

This document outlines the Infrastructure Due Diligence Analyst role, focusing on the analytical foundation of infrastructure investing and the pathway from graduate analyst to experienced investment professional.

=== A Day in the Life

*6:30am - 7:30am*: Early start preparing for management presentation on *Melbourne Port Expansion Project* - your team is conducting due diligence on a potential AU\$850 million investment for a 25% equity stake in a container terminal expansion and 40-year concession. This is a competitive auction process with binding bid due in three weeks.

Review materials from yesterday's site visit: walked the existing terminal, met operations team, saw planned expansion footprint. Key impressions: current terminal operating near capacity (85% utilization vs 90% efficient maximum), expansion adds two new berths and 600 meters of wharf, automated stacking cranes (reducing labor costs but high capex), rail connection to inland distribution centers (competitive advantage vs road-only terminals).

Check overnight updates: Container shipping data shows Melbourne import volumes up 4.2% YoY (stronger than our 3.5% base case assumption - positive). Competitor terminal (DP World) announced capacity expansion - concerning as could lead to oversupply. Flag for discussion in management meeting.

Finalize questions for today's management presentation. Priority areas: 1) Customer contract renewal rates and pipeline (how sticky are shipping line relationships?), 2) Pricing power and tariff escalation mechanisms (CPI-linked or negotiated?), 3) Expansion project execution risk (construction timeline, cost overruns, commissioning delays), 4) Competitive response to expansion (will DP World retaliate on pricing?), 5) Regulatory constraints (port access regime, potential for regulated pricing).

*7:30am - 8:30am*: Review financial model built over past two weeks. Model structure:
- Revenue: Container volumes (import/export split) × tariff per TEU (20-foot equivalent unit), with separate pricing for import/export/empty containers
- Variable costs: Labor (stevedoring, equipment operators), equipment maintenance, utilities
- Fixed costs: Management, insurance, property taxes
- Capex: Expansion capex (AU\$420M over 3 years), sustaining capex (AU\$15-20M annually for equipment replacement, wharf maintenance)
- Financing: 60% project-level debt (15-year amortizing, 5.2% interest rate), 40% equity
- Concession: 40-year term, residual value assumption at end

Key model outputs reviewed:
- Equity IRR: 11.2% (vs 10% target hurdle rate - adequate but not compelling)
- Equity value: AU\$315M (implies AU\$855M enterprise value at 60% LTV - in line with seller's asking price)
- Sensitivity to volume growth: +1% volume growth → +0.8% IRR (high operational leverage due to fixed cost base)
- Downside case (2% volume growth vs 3.5% base): 9.1% IRR (below hurdle - concerning)

Model assumption you're most uncertain about: *Volume growth forecast*. Current model uses 3.5% CAGR over 40 years, based on: 1) Victorian population growth (1.5%), 2) Import intensity growth (0.8%), 3) Market share gains from new capacity (1.2%). But this feels aggressive - Melbourne competes with Sydney, freight patterns shifting to air cargo for high-value goods, potential for supply chain reshoring reducing imports. Need to pressure-test this assumption with management today.

*8:30am - 10:30am*: Management presentation at seller's office. Attendees from your team: Investment Director (your boss), Investment Manager (mid-level, you report to), you, and infrastructure engineer from external technical advisor. Seller side: Port CEO, CFO, COO, Head of Commercial.

Investment Director leads discussion, you take detailed notes and ask specific questions when prompted.

*Volume & Market Dynamics* (CEO presenting):
- Historical volume: CAGR 4.1% over past 10 years (above national average 3.2%), driven by Melbourne's population growth and economic diversification
- Future outlook: Expect 3-4% annual growth driven by population (Victoria targeting 10M by 2050 vs 7M today), import intensity remains stable
- Competition: DP World expansion announced yesterday is "defensive capex" to retain customers, not aggressive capacity addition - CEO believes market can absorb both expansions
- You ask: "What's driving above-average volume growth vs Sydney?" CEO responds: Victorian government investment in inland freight hubs (rail connectivity), Melbourne's emergence as distribution center for southeast Australia, Port of Melbourne's proximity to Melbourne Airport for air-sea intermodal.

*Customer Contracts* (Head of Commercial):
- Top 10 shipping lines represent 75% of volume (high concentration but typical for industry)
- Average contract duration 3-5 years with major lines, annual negotiations with smaller customers
- Renewal rate: >90% over past decade (high customer retention)
- Pricing: Tariffs adjust annually with CPI + productivity offset (typically CPI + 2-3%)
- You ask: "What happens if DP World expansion leads to pricing competition?" Response: "Shipping lines value reliability and speed - they're reluctant to switch terminals to save 5% on tariffs. Our expansion maintains service quality while adding capacity."

*Expansion Project Execution* (COO):
- Construction timeline: 36 months (mobilization 6 months, marine works 18 months, equipment installation 12 months)
- Key risks: Marine construction (rock seabed requires extensive dredging and piling), equipment lead times (automated cranes from Finland - 18-month delivery), weather delays (winter construction window constraints)
- Mitigation: Fixed-price construction contract with tier-1 contractor (Laing O'Rourke), liquidated damages for delays, contingency budget 10% of base capex
- Investment Manager asks: "What's your confidence in AU\$420M capex estimate?" COO: "High confidence - 90% of costs are fixed-price contracts, 10% is equipment procurement with firm quotes. Main risk is scope creep from design changes, but design is now frozen."

*Regulatory Environment* (CFO):
- Port of Melbourne operates under 50-year concession granted 2016 (privatization), with Victorian state government as concession grantor
- Access regime: "Negotiate-arbitrate" framework - ports negotiate tariffs with shipping lines, Essential Services Commission (ESC) arbitrates disputes
- Historical precedent: ESC rarely intervenes (2 arbitrations in 8 years, both resulted in modest tariff reductions <5%)
- Risk: Future government intervention if port seen as monopolistic, but CFO views as low probability given privatization framework and importance of port to Victorian economy

Meeting concludes with agreement to provide additional information: 1) Customer contract templates and renewal history, 2) Detailed expansion project cost breakdown, 3) Traffic model assumptions and methodology, 4) Independent engineer's report on asset condition.

*10:30am - 11:30am*: Debrief with Investment Director and Investment Manager. Assessment: Generally positive presentation, management credible, but volume growth assumptions need scrutiny. Investment Director asks you to: 1) Revise volume forecast with more conservative assumptions, 2) Build downside case with 2% volume growth and competitive pricing pressure, 3) Research DP World expansion in detail - what's their timeline, capacity addition, potential impact?

You raise concern: "11.2% base case IRR is barely above hurdle. If we apply more conservative volume growth, returns may be unacceptable. Should we consider whether there's any negotiating room on price?" Investment Director responds: "Good thinking. Let's build a sensitivity showing IRR at different purchase prices. If we need 12% IRR for committee approval, what valuation does that imply? Prepare analysis for internal discussion next week."

*11:30am - 1:00pm*: Back at office, begin updating financial model with information from management presentation. Key changes:
1. Update capex schedule based on COO's construction timeline (phased deployment vs straight-line assumption)
2. Incorporate customer concentration risk by modeling contract rollover (90% retention rate, 10% volume at risk each 3-5 year contract renewal)
3. Add regulatory risk scenario (5% tariff reduction possibility with 20% probability - reduces NPV by ~AU\$40M)
4. Build competitive response scenario (DP World expansion leads to 5% tariff reduction for 3 years to retain customers)

Run updated model - base case IRR drops to 10.8% (from 11.2%) after incorporating these risks. Concerning - getting close to hurdle rate.

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Lunch at desk while researching DP World Melbourne expansion. Google search finds: media release announcing AU\$300M investment over 5 years, adding 100,000 TEU capacity (vs current 250,000 TEU - this is 40% capacity increase, material addition). Expected completion 2027, same timing as Melbourne Port's expansion.

Calculate market supply/demand balance: Current total Melbourne container capacity ~3.0M TEU, operating at ~85% = 2.55M actual volume. With both expansions: capacity increases to ~3.5M TEU. Demand growth at 3.5% CAGR → 3.0M TEU by 2028. Implied utilization: 3.0M / 3.5M = 86% - similar to today. Conclusion: Market can likely absorb both expansions without severe pricing pressure, but margin for error is slim. If volume growth disappoints (e.g., 2% not 3.5%), utilization drops to 78% creating oversupply and pricing pressure.

Document findings in memo for Investment Director: "DP World expansion is material capacity addition but market fundamentals remain supportive assuming volume growth achieves 3%+ CAGR. Key risk: volume growth underperformance would create excess capacity and pricing pressure. Recommend conservative volume assumptions (2.5-3%) for base case given competitive dynamics."

*2:00pm - 3:30pm*: Work on building comprehensive downside scenario as requested. Assumptions for downside case:
- Volume growth: 2.0% CAGR (vs 3.5% base case) - assumes weaker population growth, some modal shift to air freight, e-commerce reducing import intensity
- Tariff growth: CPI + 1% (vs CPI + 2.5% base case) - reflects competitive pressure from DP World expansion
- Expansion project cost overrun: 5% (AU\$21M additional capex) - typical construction contingency
- Opex inflation: CPI + 1% (vs CPI flat base case) - labor cost pressures, energy costs

Run model with downside assumptions - sobering results:
- Equity IRR: 8.2% (well below 10% hurdle)
- Equity value: AU\$195M (implies maximum enterprise value AU\$665M at 60% LTV - this is 22% below asking price of AU\$855M)
- Debt service coverage: Still acceptable (1.45x average DSCR) but tighter than base case (1.75x)

Create sensitivity table showing IRR at various volume growth rates and purchase prices:

#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto, auto),
  [*Purchase Price*], [*2.0% Volume*], [*2.5% Volume*], [*3.0% Volume*], [*3.5% Volume*],
  [AU\$855M (ask)], [8.2%], [9.3%], [10.4%], [11.2%],
  [AU\$800M (-6%)], [9.1%], [10.2%], [11.4%], [12.3%],
  [AU\$750M (-12%)], [10.1%], [11.3%], [12.6%], [13.5%],
)

Conclusion: To achieve 12% target IRR with conservative volume assumptions (2.5-3%), would need to negotiate 6-12% discount to asking price. Document for discussion with Investment Director.

*3:30pm - 4:30pm*: Team meeting to discuss Melbourne Port and other active opportunities. Investment Director asks for your preliminary view on Melbourne Port. You present:

"Base case returns are acceptable (10.8% IRR) but not compelling given risks. Key concerns: 1) Volume growth assumptions appear aggressive given competitive capacity additions, 2) Customer concentration creates contract renewal risk, 3) Limited pricing power if DP World competes aggressively, 4) Returns very sensitive to volume - each 50bp reduction in volume growth reduces IRR by ~80bp.

Recommendation: This asset has merit (high-quality infrastructure, strong market position, good regulatory framework) but pricing is full. Suggest we include in bid process but target 5-10% discount to seller's asking price to achieve acceptable risk-adjusted returns. If competitive tension drives price to full asking price or higher, recommend we pass - better opportunities exist in pipeline."

Investment Director appreciates analysis, agrees with assessment. He'll discuss strategy with Investment Committee chair before deciding bid level. If we bid, binding bid due in 3 weeks - you'll have a busy few weeks refining model, coordinating technical/legal due diligence, drafting investment committee paper.

Discussion shifts to other opportunities in pipeline:
- *Solar Farm Portfolio* (AU\$350M, 4 operating solar farms + development pipeline): Investment Manager leading, you'll support financial modeling next week
- *Regional Airport* (AU\$180M, 30-year concession): Early-stage review, Investment Director wants preliminary valuation to decide whether to proceed to detailed due diligence
- *Fiber Network* (AU\$520M, wholesale fiber-to-the-premises network): Competitive auction, due diligence ongoing, IC paper due in 2 weeks - you'll contribute regulatory and competitive analysis

Priorities assigned: 1) Finalize Melbourne Port analysis and IC materials (if bid proceeds), 2) Build preliminary model for Regional Airport (due Friday), 3) Support Solar Farm due diligence (starting next week).

*4:30pm - 5:30pm*: Work on Regional Airport preliminary analysis. Information package from seller limited at this stage: 5 years historical financials, traffic data, concession agreement summary. This is "quick look" analysis to determine if asset warrants full due diligence.

Build simple DCF model with key assumptions:
- Passenger numbers: 1.2M annually, growing 2.5% (regional population growth + tourism)
- Revenue: Aeronautical (landing fees, passenger charges), Non-aeronautical (retail concessions, parking, property leases) - split ~60/40
- Margins: High operating leverage (80% gross margin on aero revenue, 40% on non-aero)
- Capex: Moderate sustaining capex (AU\$5-8M annually), major runway resurfacing required in year 8 (AU\$35M)
- Concession: 30-year term, terminal value at reversion

Quick valuation: Enterprise value ~AU\$160-200M depending on terminal value assumptions. Seller asking AU\$180M - appears reasonable. Equity IRR (assuming 50% LTV): 10-11% range - meets hurdle.

Key questions to investigate in full due diligence if proceeding:
1. Traffic sustainability: Is 2.5% growth realistic given regional economic outlook? What's risk of airline route cancellations?
2. Non-aero revenue: What's contractual vs merchant exposure? Renewal risk on retail concessions?
3. Regulatory: Council relationship (airport is critical infrastructure), potential for regulatory intervention on charges?
4. Capex: Is AU\$35M runway resurfacing estimate robust? Other major capex lurking?

Draft memo for Investment Director: "Regional Airport appears interesting at first pass - pricing reasonable, returns adequate, manageable size for fund. Recommend proceeding to Phase 2 due diligence. Key workstreams: traffic consultant to validate forecasts, technical engineer to assess capex, legal to review concession agreement and regulatory framework."

*5:30pm - 6:15pm*: Review and provide comments on draft IC paper for *Renewable Energy Portfolio* (different analyst leading). Paper proposes investing AU\$280M in portfolio of wind and solar farms with 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs). Read through carefully, provide feedback:

- Financial model: Merchant tail risk (post-PPA expiry) seems underestimated - recommend more conservative merchant price assumptions and higher discount rate for tail cash flows
- PPA counterparty risk: Concentrated exposure to single offtaker (major retailer) - should assess counterparty credit risk more thoroughly
- Renewable energy policy: Paper assumes federal renewable energy target remains stable - suggest scenario analysis with policy changes (less favorable support mechanisms)
- Execution risk: Development pipeline component requires construction - recommend detailed assessment of development approvals, grid connection, construction risk

Send comments to lead analyst with constructive framing - these transactions are team efforts and important to support colleagues while maintaining analytical rigor.

*6:15pm - 6:45pm*: Catch up on emails and administrative tasks. Key items:
- Technical advisor sends Melbourne Port technical due diligence report (350 pages) - flag to read tonight, key sections on asset condition, capex forecast validation, operational efficiency benchmarking
- Legal advisor requests call tomorrow on Regional Airport concession agreement - provisions around termination rights, regulatory change, force majeure events
- Investment Director sends email: "Great work on Melbourne Port analysis. Let's discuss bid strategy Monday morning. Also, can you prepare 1-page summary of Solar Farm opportunity for Thursday's team meeting?"

Respond to urgent items, defer less time-sensitive emails until tomorrow.

*Evening*: Leave office around 6:45pm. Tonight take home Melbourne Port technical DD report - read key sections (executive summary, asset condition assessment, capex review, operational benchmarking). Technical advisor concludes: 1) Asset in good condition, maintenance has been appropriate, 2) Expansion capex estimate reasonable but recommend 12% contingency vs 10%, 3) Operational efficiency comparable to best-in-class Australian terminals.

This validates financial model assumptions - useful confirmation. Incorporate 12% contingency recommendation into model (adds AU\$8M capex, reduces IRR by ~15bp - marginal impact).

Tomorrow: Full day in office, morning meeting with Investment Director on Melbourne Port bid strategy, afternoon drafting preliminary IC paper outline (even though bid decision not final, good to start drafting to identify information gaps), evening working on Solar Farm preliminary financial model.

== Conclusion

The Infrastructure Due Diligence Analyst role offers a unique career path combining rigorous financial analysis, technical understanding, and long-term investment thinking. Unlike traditional equity research focused on quarterly earnings and stock price movements, infrastructure investing requires evaluating assets with 20-50+ year investment horizons, complex regulatory frameworks, and tangible societal impacts.

Australia's mature infrastructure privatization program, combined with significant institutional capital seeking infrastructure exposure, creates excellent opportunities for aspiring infrastructure investors. The sector spans traditional assets (toll roads, airports, energy networks) through to emerging opportunities (renewable energy, digital infrastructure, social infrastructure), providing diverse career pathways.

For university students considering this field, strong quantitative skills (finance, economics, engineering) provide the foundation, but success requires developing commercial judgment, sector expertise, and the ability to think in decades rather than quarters. The work is intellectually challenging - evaluating traffic forecasts in a world of autonomous vehicles, electricity demand with distributed generation, airport economics post-pandemic - requiring both analytical rigor and strategic vision.

The pathway from graduate analyst to experienced infrastructure investor typically spans 8-12 years, with opportunities to specialize by sector (transport, energy, digital) or function (due diligence, asset management, origination). The skills developed - complex valuation, regulatory analysis, project finance, ESG integration - are highly transferable across infrastructure investing, investment banking, consulting, government, and infrastructure operating companies.

The most successful infrastructure analysts combine quantitative excellence with curiosity about how infrastructure assets function, economies evolve, and societies develop. They balance financial discipline (achieving target returns) with recognition that infrastructure investments support economic growth, connect communities, and enable decarbonization. For those who enjoy combining detailed analytical work with long-term strategic thinking and real-world impact, infrastructure investing offers deeply rewarding career opportunities.
