== Overview: What Does a Derivatives & Hedging Analyst Do?

Derivatives and hedging analysts at superannuation funds implement sophisticated hedging strategies to manage the fund's exposure to market risks (currency, interest rates, equity markets, commodities). They work within the Investment Management division, typically in a dedicated derivatives/hedging team or within portfolio management, supporting the fund's multi-billion dollar investment portfolio.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *Investment Bank Derivatives Trader*: Bank traders make markets and take proprietary risk for profit. Super fund derivatives analysts execute hedges to reduce risk for member portfolios, focusing on cost-effective risk management rather than P&L generation.
- *Sell-Side Structurer*: Structurers at banks design derivative products for clients. Super fund analysts are the buy-side clients who evaluate, negotiate, and implement these structures for their fund's benefit.
- *Portfolio Manager*: PMs make asset allocation and investment decisions. Derivatives analysts implement the hedging and risk management strategies that support those decisions.
- *Quantitative Analyst*: Quants build pricing models and trading algorithms. Derivatives analysts use those models to value positions, assess hedging effectiveness, and implement strategies.
- *Risk Manager*: Risk managers monitor and report on risk across the portfolio. Derivatives analysts actively manage and hedge specific risks through derivative instruments.

*Core Responsibilities of Derivatives & Hedging Analysts:*

1. *Currency Hedging*: Managing foreign exchange exposure from international equity and bond investments (typically 30-50% of super fund portfolios)
2. *Interest Rate Risk Management*: Using swaps, futures, and options to manage duration and yield curve exposure in fixed income portfolios
3. *Equity Derivatives*: Implementing protective strategies (put options, collars) and tactical overlays (futures, index options) for equity portfolios
4. *Derivative Valuation*: Marking-to-market derivative positions, validating bank pricing, calculating hedge effectiveness
5. *Counterparty Management*: Negotiating ISDA agreements, managing counterparty credit risk, optimizing collateral arrangements
6. *Strategy Implementation*: Executing hedging programs efficiently, minimizing transaction costs, managing operational complexity
7. *Performance Attribution*: Analyzing contribution of hedging strategies to fund returns, reporting to investment committee
8. *Regulatory Compliance*: Ensuring derivative use complies with APRA requirements, investment mandate restrictions, and internal risk limits

*Work Environment:*

Super fund derivatives teams typically comprise 3-10 people depending on fund size, working closely with portfolio managers, risk teams, and external investment banks. Work combines quantitative analysis (modelling, valuation, data analysis) with market interaction (trading execution, counterparty negotiation) and strategic thinking (hedging program design). The role requires balancing analytical rigor with practical implementation and cost considerations.

=== A Day in the Life: Junior Derivatives Analyst, AustralianSuper (Melbourne)

*7:30am - 8:00am*: Arrive early to review overnight markets before team arrives. Check key overnight developments:
- USD/AUD opened at 0.6485 (down from 0.6510 close) - AUD weakened overnight
- US 10-year treasury yields up 8bp to 4.15% (Fed speaker hawkish)
- ASX 200 futures down 0.6% (following weak US close)
- Oil up 2.5% on Middle East tensions

Review emails from counterparty banks - UBS sent daily collateral statement showing margin call of AU\$2.3m (equity option positions moved against fund). Need to process this morning.

*8:00am - 8:30am*: Process urgent collateral requirements:
- Review UBS margin call calculation - validate that equity put option positions lost value as market fell
- Confirm cash available in fund's margin account (AU\$8.5m available, sufficient for call)
- Instruct custodian (Northern Trust) to transfer AU\$2.3m to UBS margin account
- Document transaction in derivatives tracking system
- Email operations team confirming collateral posted

*8:30am - 9:00am*: Daily derivatives team meeting (5 people: Head of Derivatives, Senior Analyst, 2 Analysts, you). Each person updates:
- Overnight market moves and impact on hedges
- Today's maturing FX forwards (USD\$450m rolling today - need to execute new 3-month forwards)
- Collateral movements (you report UBS margin call processed)
- Issues or blockers (Senior analyst flags that NAB pricing on AUD/EUR forwards looks wide - may need to shop other banks)

Manager sets priorities: "Main focus today is FX hedge roll - we've got USD\$450m forwards maturing, need to roll into new 3-month contracts. Get competitive quotes from at least 3 banks. Also, PM team wants updated analysis on currency hedge performance for investment committee next week - can you start pulling data?"

*9:00am - 10:30am*: Execute FX forward roll:

*Background*: Fund has USD\$8.2bn in US equity portfolio (S&P 500 index), policy is to hedge 50% of FX exposure = USD\$4.1bn hedged using rolling 3-month forward contracts. Today USD\$450m of forwards are maturing.

*Step 1 - Calculate new hedge requirement*:
- Check latest portfolio valuation: USD equity now worth USD\$8.35bn (market up, portfolio grew)
- New 50% hedge target = USD\$4.175bn
- Existing hedges (excluding maturing forwards): USD\$3.725bn
- Need to roll USD\$450m PLUS top-up hedge by USD\$0.45m (round to USD\$450m for simplicity)

*Step 2 - Solicit competitive quotes*:
- Bloomberg message to FX traders at UBS, NAB, Macquarie: "Request 3-month AUD/USD forward quote for USD\$450m (we sell USD, buy AUD). Live quote please, 2-minute validity."
- Receive quotes:
  - UBS: 0.6490 (we receive AUD at this rate when selling USD)
  - NAB: 0.6488 (slightly worse)
  - Macquarie: 0.6491 (best rate)
- Implied forward points: Spot 0.6485, 3-month forward 0.6491 = +60 points (AUD trading at forward premium, reflects interest rate differential - Australian rates slightly higher than US)

*Step 3 - Execute trade*:
- Bloomberg message to Macquarie trader: "Done. Sell USD\$450m vs AUD at 0.6491, settlement 3 months (March 28, 2026). Please confirm details."
- Macquarie confirms: "Confirmed. USD\$450m sold, AUD\$693.1m bought, value date 28-Mar-2026, mid-market reference 0.6485, all-in 0.6491."
- Save trade confirmation, enter into derivatives system
- Calculate expected P&L: If spot in 3 months is still 0.6485, we lock in forward rate of 0.6491, gain 60 points × USD\$450m = ~AU\$415k gain (benefit of forward premium)

Total execution time: 15 minutes for quotes, 5 minutes for trade, 10 minutes for documentation.

*10:30am - 11:30am*: Work on currency hedge performance analysis for investment committee:

Pull data for past 12 months showing:
- Fund's international equity returns (unhedged vs hedged)
- FX impact on portfolio performance
- Hedging costs/benefits

Build Excel analysis:

*12-Month Performance (International Equity Portfolio):*
- Unhedged return (local currency): +12.5% (S&P 500 in USD terms)
- AUD/USD moved from 0.6650 to 0.6485 = AUD strengthened 2.5%
- Hedged return (AUD terms): +12.5% - 2.5% = +10.0%
- 50% hedge position: Actual return = +11.25% (halfway between hedged and unhedged)

*Hedging Costs:*
- Forward points cost over 12 months: -45bp (rolling forwards at premium to spot due to interest rate differential)
- Transaction costs (bid-offer spreads): -8bp
- Total hedging costs: -53bp

*Net Impact of Hedging:*
- Without hedge: +10.0% (AUD strengthened, reduced USD returns in AUD terms)
- With 50% hedge: +11.25% (partial protection from AUD strength)
- Hedging benefit: +125bp (hedging added value as AUD strengthened)
- Less hedging costs: -53bp
- Net hedging contribution: +72bp (0.72% additional return from hedging program)

Create charts showing monthly FX impact and cumulative hedging contribution. Save analysis for senior analyst to review tomorrow.

*11:30am - 12:00pm*: Valuation work - mark-to-market equity option positions.

Fund holds protective put options on ASX 200 index (downside protection if market crashes):
- Position: Long 2,000 contracts, ASX 200 put options, strike 7,000, expiry June 2026
- Current ASX 200 level: 7,650
- Yesterday's value: AU\$3.2m (marked using Bloomberg OVME screen)
- Today's value: Check Bloomberg for updated price... AU\$2.9m
- Daily P&L: -AU\$300k (market moved up, puts lost value as expected)

Validate pricing using Black-Scholes model in Excel:
- Spot: 7,650 | Strike: 7,000 | Time to expiry: 180 days | Implied vol: 14% | Risk-free rate: 4.0%
- Model value: AU\$2.95m per 2,000 contracts = AU\$2.95m total
- Bloomberg value: AU\$2.9m
- Difference: AU\$50k (within acceptable tolerance, likely different vol assumption)

Accept Bloomberg valuation, update derivatives database, calculate Greeks:
- Delta: -0.25 (for every 1-point move in ASX 200, puts move AU\$1,250)
- Vega: AU\$85,000 per 1% vol change (sensitive to volatility changes)
- Theta: -AU\$18,000 per day (time decay cost)

Document in daily valuation report.

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch at desk while reading risk management research. Today: Reading Vanguard paper on "Currency Hedging for Australian Investors" - understanding academic research on optimal hedge ratios, whether active currency management adds value vs passive hedging. Key takeaway: Passive hedging (e.g., 50% fixed ratio) generally more cost-effective than active currency views for most institutional investors.

*1:00pm - 2:30pm*: Reconciliation work - matching derivative positions across systems.

Monthly task: Ensure all systems agree on derivative holdings:
- Fund accounting system (SimCorp)
- Custodian records (Northern Trust)
- Counterparty confirmations (DTCC, Markit)
- Internal derivatives database

Today focusing on interest rate swap reconciliation:
- Fund has 12 AUD interest rate swaps (notional AU\$2.8bn) used to manage duration in bond portfolio
- Extract swap details from each system
- Compare notional amounts, fixed rates, payment dates, maturity dates

*Break found*: One swap showing notional of AU\$200m in fund accounting but AU\$205m in custodian system.
- Investigate: Check trade confirmation - original trade was AU\$205m
- Found issue: Fund accounting team entered AU\$200m incorrectly last month
- Notify fund accounting team, request correction
- Document in reconciliation report with resolution timeline

This detailed reconciliation work is unglamorous but critical - errors can lead to inaccurate reporting, failed audits, or missed risk exposures.

*2:30pm - 3:30pm*: Research project - evaluating new hedging strategy proposed by portfolio manager.

*Background*: Emerging Markets equity PM wants to implement currency overlay to manage volatility in EM currencies (BRL, INR, MXN, etc.). Currently unhedged. Proposes hedging 30% of EM currency exposure using 6-month rolling forwards.

*Your task*: Analyze feasibility and expected costs.

Analysis in Excel:
- Current EM equity exposure: AU\$850m across 15 currencies
- Largest exposures: USD\$120m, EUR\$85m, INR\$95m equivalent, BRL\$65m equivalent
- Problem: Many EM currencies have illiquid forward markets with wide bid-offer spreads
- Pull Bloomberg data on 6-month forward costs:
  - BRL: 600bp premium (Brazilian real forwards very expensive due to high interest rates)
  - INR: 180bp premium
  - MXN: 120bp premium
  - ZAR: 350bp premium

Calculate expected annual hedging cost for 30% hedge:
- Weighted average forward cost: ~320bp per annum
- Applied to 30% hedge = 96bp annual cost on hedged portion = 29bp total portfolio cost

Draft preliminary findings:
- *Pros*: Reduced portfolio volatility, protection from EM currency crashes
- *Cons*: High hedging costs (29bp drag on returns), operational complexity (15 currency pairs, some illiquid), difficult to execute large size without market impact
- *Recommendation*: Consider alternatives - (1) smaller hedge ratio (10-15% instead of 30%), (2) selective hedging (only hedge most liquid currencies like MXN, INR, avoid expensive BRL, ZAR), (3) options instead of forwards (put options for downside protection, avoid full cost of forwards)

Email draft analysis to senior analyst for review before presenting to PM.

*3:30pm - 4:30pm*: Counterparty meeting via videoconference with J.P. Morgan derivatives sales team.

*Agenda*: Review Q4 trading activity, discuss new product offerings, update on regulatory changes.

JPM presents:
- Fund executed AU\$2.1bn notional derivatives with JPM this quarter (FX forwards, interest rate swaps, equity options)
- JPM market share: ~18% of fund's derivative activity (one of top 3 counterparties)
- New product: Offering customized FX forward strategies with automated rebalancing (reduces operational burden)
- Regulatory update: New APRA requirements for derivative reporting - JPM enhancing trade reporting capabilities

You ask questions:
- "What's all-in pricing for automated FX rebalancing service?" (JPM: 2-3bp on top of standard forward points, depends on volume)
- "Can you provide better pricing on AUD/CNH forwards? We've been using competitors for offshore renminbi hedges." (JPM: "We'll review pricing, expect proposal next week")
- "When will new APRA reporting be ready?" (JPM: "Implementation March 2026, we'll provide testing environment in January")

Positive meeting - maintain good relationship with key counterparty, explore new services, ensure competitive pricing.

*4:30pm - 5:15pm*: Ad-hoc request from portfolio manager - equity derivatives question.

PM: "ASX 200 has rallied 8% this month, we're above benchmark weight on Australian equities. I'm considering selling some index futures to reduce exposure temporarily (rather than selling physical stocks). Can you analyze the costs and mechanics?"

You respond: "Happy to help. Here's quick analysis":
- Current ASX 200: 7,650
- 3-month ASX SPI futures: 7,675 (25-point premium to spot, reflects dividends and funding cost)
- To reduce exposure by AU\$500m equity value: Need to sell ~652 futures contracts (AU\$25 per point × 7,650 = AU\$191,250 per contract, so AU\$500m ÷ AU\$191,250 = 2,613... wait, recalculate: AU\$25 per index point, so 1 contract = AU\$25 × 7,675 = AU\$191,875 notional, so AU\$500m ÷ AU\$191,875 = 2,606 contracts)

Actually you realize error and recalculate carefully:
- ASX SPI futures multiplier: AU\$25 per index point
- Index level: 7,675 (futures price)
- Notional per contract: AU\$25 × 7,675 = AU\$191,875
- Target exposure reduction: AU\$500m
- Contracts needed: AU\$500m ÷ AU\$191,875 = 2,606 contracts (round to 2,600)

*Costs*:
- Bid-offer spread: ~0.5-1.0 index points = AU\$1,250-2,500 per contract = AU\$3.25m-6.5m total (quite expensive!)
- Futures roll cost: When 3-month contract expires, need to roll into new contract (costs ~5bp per roll) = AU\$2.5m over 12 months if held that long
- Margin requirement: ~5% of notional = AU\$25m tied up in margin

*Alternative*: Instead of futures, could sell physical stocks incrementally over several days using VWAP algo (lower market impact, no margin, but slower execution and more operational complexity)

Draft quick email to PM with analysis, suggest discussion tomorrow about optimal approach.

*5:15pm - 5:45pm*: Wrap up daily tasks:
- Update derivatives position tracker with today's trades (FX forward roll, collateral movements)
- Complete daily checklist (collateral processed ✓, maturing trades rolled ✓, valuations updated ✓, reconciliations clean ✓)
- Review tomorrow's calendar: 9am hedge rebalancing, 2pm APRA reporting working group
- Send email to team with summary of today's FX forward execution and preliminary feedback on EM currency hedge proposal

*5:45pm - 6:00pm*: Head home. Generally work 7:30am-6:00pm, though during month-end reporting can extend to 6:30-7pm. Weekend work rare unless urgent market event (e.g., major currency crisis requiring emergency hedging).

*Evening*: Optional professional development - studying for CFA Level II exam (sitting in June). Many derivatives analysts pursue CFA to deepen investment knowledge and enhance career prospects. Also might review tonight's readings on exotic options for better understanding of structured products banks pitch to the fund.

Derivatives and hedging roles at superannuation funds offer intellectually stimulating work combining quantitative analysis, market interaction, and strategic risk management. The work directly supports retirement outcomes for millions of Australians by managing portfolio risks cost-effectively.

Compared to sell-side derivatives roles, super fund positions offer better work-life balance (7:30am-6pm typical vs 6:30am-8pm+ in banking), more strategic long-term focus, and purpose-driven mission, though typically with lower compensation (base salaries competitive but smaller bonuses than investment banks).

For finance students strong in mathematics who want to work with derivatives in an institutional investment setting, super fund derivatives roles provide an excellent career combining technical complexity with practical impact, reasonable work-life balance, and progression to senior investment leadership positions.
