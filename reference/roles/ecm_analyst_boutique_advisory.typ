= ECM Analyst (Boutique Corporate Advisory) - Career Pathways

This document outlines career progression for Equity Capital Markets (ECM) analyst roles at boutique corporate advisory firms in Australia. ECM professionals advise companies on raising equity capital through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), secondary raisings, block trades, and other equity transactions.

== Overview: What Does an ECM Analyst Do?

ECM analysts at boutique advisory firms (such as Barrenjoey, Lazard Australia, Greenhill Australia) work on equity fundraising transactions, helping companies access public markets to raise capital for growth, acquisitions, balance sheet restructuring, or shareholder liquidity. They combine financial analysis, market assessment, transaction execution, and client advisory.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *M&A Analyst*: M&A analysts advise on mergers, acquisitions, and corporate takeovers. ECM analysts focus specifically on equity capital raising (IPOs, placements, rights issues). Some boutiques have integrated teams, others separate ECM from M&A.
- *Equity Research Analyst*: Research analysts publish investment recommendations on stocks for investors. ECM analysts advise companies raising capital and coordinate with investors but don't publish independent research (conflict of interest).
- *Institutional Equity Sales*: Salespeople at brokers distribute equity offerings to institutional investors. ECM analysts work on the issuer side, structuring deals and advising companies, while coordinating with brokers who distribute to investors.
- *Private Equity Analyst*: PE analysts evaluate investment opportunities for PE funds. ECM analysts advise companies on public market fundraising.
- *Debt Capital Markets (DCM) Analyst*: DCM focuses on bond and loan capital raising. ECM focuses on equity (shares, not debt).

*Core Responsibilities of ECM Analysts:*

1. *Transaction Execution*: Supporting IPOs, secondary offerings, and block trades from pitch through execution and settlement
2. *Financial Analysis*: Building detailed company models, performing valuations, creating comparable company analyses
3. *Market Assessment*: Analyzing public market conditions, investor appetite, comparable transactions, and optimal timing
4. *Deal Structuring*: Advising on offer size, pricing, structure (institutional vs retail split, underwriting vs bookbuild)
5. *Due Diligence*: Coordinating financial, legal, and operational due diligence across advisors (lawyers, accountants, tax advisors)
6. *Due Diligence Committee*: Participating in formal due diligence committee meetings where transaction risks are identified, verified, and documented to ensure prospectus accuracy and manage legal liability
7. *Documentation*: Drafting and reviewing prospectuses, offer documents, investor presentations, and research materials
8. *Investor Relations Support*: Helping companies prepare for roadshows, coordinating investor meetings, managing Q&A preparation
9. *Regulatory Compliance*: Ensuring transactions comply with ASX listing rules, ASIC requirements, Corporations Act provisions

*Work Environment:*

Boutique corporate advisory ECM teams are typically small (3-10 people depending on firm size), working on 2-5 active transactions simultaneously. Work is intensely deadline-driven around transaction milestones (prospectus lodgement, roadshow, pricing, settlement). The role combines analytical work (modelling, valuation) with coordination across multiple parties (company management, lawyers, accountants, underwriters, ASX, ASIC) and client service (responsiveness, problem-solving).

=== A Day in the Life: Analyst, ECM Team, Boutique Advisory Firm (Sydney)

*Context*: Currently working on two active deals:
1. *Project Aurora* - AU\$350m IPO of technology company (SaaS business, growing rapidly, backed by PE fund seeking exit)
2. *Project Phoenix* - AU\$180m institutional placement for ASX-listed healthcare company (funding acquisition)

*8:00am - 9:00am*: Arrive at office (earlier than typical 9am corporate hours - deal teams start early). Check overnight emails:
- Lawyers sent revised draft prospectus for Project Aurora at midnight (they've been working late to meet ASIC lodgement deadline Friday)
- Company CFO (Project Phoenix) asking for updated dilution analysis with different placement scenarios
- Associate requests you prepare comparable company analysis for new pitch (mining company considering IPO)

Review today's priorities:
- Review and comment on Aurora prospectus revisions (due back to lawyers by 12pm)
- Update Phoenix dilution model and send to CFO by 10am
- Prepare for 2pm Aurora management presentation (investor roadshow pitch rehearsal)
- Start comparable analysis for mining pitch (needed by tomorrow morning)

*9:00am - 10:00am*: Update Project Phoenix dilution model:

*Background*: Healthcare company wants to raise AU\$180m to fund acquisition. Considering two structures:
1. Institutional placement at market price
2. 1-for-10 pro-rata rights issue (all shareholders can participate)

Client wants to see dilution impact on existing shareholders under both scenarios.

Open Excel model:
- Current shares outstanding: 450m
- Current share price: AU\$4.20
- Market cap: AU\$1,890m

*Scenario 1 - Institutional Placement*:
- New shares issued: AU\$180m ÷ AU\$4.20 = 42.9m shares (assuming at-market pricing)
- Post-raise shares: 450m + 42.9m = 492.9m
- Dilution to existing holders: 42.9m ÷ 492.9m = 8.7% dilution
- BUT: Placements typically priced at 2-3% discount to TERP (Theoretical Ex-Rights Price)
- Assuming 2.5% discount: Price = AU\$4.10, new shares = AU\$180m ÷ AU\$4.10 = 43.9m
- Revised dilution: 43.9m ÷ 493.9m = 8.9%

*Scenario 2 - Rights Issue (1-for-10)*:
- New shares: 450m ÷ 10 = 45m shares
- Raising: Need AU\$180m, so price = AU\$180m ÷ 45m = AU\$4.00 per share (4.8% discount to current price)
- Post-raise shares: 495m
- Dilution to non-participants: If some shareholders don't participate, they get diluted more
- Assumption: 90% take-up, 10% shares shortfall placed to institutions
- Dilution to non-participants: ~9.5%

Create comparison table showing:
- Structure comparison (placement vs rights issue)
- Pricing (AU\$4.10 vs AU\$4.00)
- Number of new shares
- Dilution impact
- Pros/cons (placement is faster/easier execution but more dilutive to retail; rights issue gives all shareholders opportunity but more complex/time-consuming)

Email model to CFO with brief summary: "Updated analysis attached. Placement ~8.9% dilution vs rights issue ~9-9.5% depending on take-up rate. Recommend placement given timing urgency for acquisition completion. Happy to discuss."

*10:00am - 12:00pm*: Review Project Aurora draft prospectus (major task requiring focused attention):

Prospectus is 250+ page legal document describing company, financials, risks, offer terms. Must be accurate and compliant with law - errors can lead to civil/criminal liability.

*Your role*: Review financial sections and business description, check for accuracy, consistency, completeness.

Systematically work through document:

*Section 1 - Investment Overview (pages 10-25)*:
- Check key statistics (offer size, price, market cap, use of proceeds) match your model
- Verify financial forecasts (FY25 revenue AU\$85m, EBITDA AU\$23m) match management board-approved forecasts
- Notice inconsistency: Page 12 says "FY25 EBITDA margin 27%", but AU\$23m ÷ AU\$85m = 27.1% - flag for lawyers to correct
- Check valuation multiples cited (peer average EV/EBITDA 18x) - cross-reference to your comparable company analysis, confirmed accurate

*Section 4 - Financial Information (pages 80-130)*:
- Review historical financial tables - check numbers match audited financials and working papers
- Notice footnote missing explaining one-off restructuring cost in FY23 - draft footnote language for lawyers
- Check forecast assumptions (revenue growth 35% pa, gross margin 75%, opex growth 25% pa) - confirm these match management forecasts and are clearly disclosed
- Verify pro-forma cap table showing share ownership post-IPO - cross-check against your model, numbers match

*Section 6 - Risk Factors (pages 150-175)*:
- Read through business risks - check all material risks are disclosed
- Notice risk around "customer concentration" mentions top customer is 15% of revenue but doesn't name customer - confirm with lawyers this is standard practice (yes, don't name customers in risk factors)
- Check financial risks section adequately describes cash flow profile and working capital requirements

*Section 9 - Investigating Accountant's Report (pages 200-220)*:
- Review accountant's review of financial information
- Check their reconciliation of statutory to pro-forma EBITDA - verify adjustments are reasonable (one-off restructuring, share-based payments, IPO costs)
- Notice AU\$2.1m accounting fees paid to Big Four firm for this report - make note for invoicing reconciliation

Compile 15 detailed comments in Word document with page references and suggested fixes. Email to lawyers by 12pm deadline: "Please see attached comments on financial sections. Main items: (1) EBITDA margin rounding inconsistency page 12, (2) missing footnote on FY23 restructuring, (3) suggested clarifications on forecast assumptions. Available to discuss this afternoon."

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch at desk (standard during busy deal periods). Eat sandwich while catching up on market news:
- ASX 200 up 0.3% today
- Notice another tech IPO priced yesterday (competitor to Project Aurora) - priced at 16x FY25 EBITDA vs our valuation range of 17-19x, concerning if market softening
- Check Aurora peer group share prices - down average 2% this week, general tech sell-off
- Make note to mention market conditions in this afternoon's management presentation rehearsal

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Prepare materials for Aurora management presentation rehearsal:

Management team presenting to institutional investors next week (roadshow). Need to practice pitch, get feedback, refine messaging.

Your tasks:
- Print 10 copies of investor presentation (45 slides)
- Setup boardroom with screen, projector, water, notebooks
- Print Q&A briefing document (anticipated investor questions with suggested answers)
- Print comparable company trading statistics (latest share prices, multiples, for management reference)
- Prepare feedback template for senior team to note comments during rehearsal

Logistics completed. Quick review of presentation to remind yourself of key messages:
- Slide 5: Investment highlights (leading SaaS platform, 98% revenue retention, 40%+ growth, strong unit economics)
- Slides 15-20: Business model and competitive advantages
- Slides 25-35: Financial performance (historical and forecast)
- Slides 36-40: Use of proceeds and growth strategy
- Slides 41-45: Board, management team, offer structure

*2:00pm - 4:00pm*: Management presentation rehearsal (full team attending - Managing Director, two Directors, Associate, you):

*Attendees from Company:*
- CEO (founder, passionate about business, sometimes too much detail)
- CFO (experienced, good with numbers, less comfortable with strategy questions)
- CTO (technical, needs to simplify language for investors)

MD opens: "Thanks for coming in. This is your practice run before we hit the road next week. We'll let you present as if we're investors, then give feedback. Let's start with CEO presenting first 20 slides, CFO taking financial section."

CEO begins presenting. You're taking notes on performance:
- Good: Clear passion and vision, strong on explaining customer value proposition
- Needs improvement: Spending 8 minutes on slide 7 (market size) - too much detail, losing audience, needs to tighten to 3 minutes
- Good: Excellent explanation of SaaS revenue model and recurring revenue
- Problem: Using too much technical jargon when explaining product - "We leverage a microservices architecture with Kubernetes orchestration..." - investors won't understand

CFO presents financial section:
- Good: Clear on historical performance and growth trajectory
- Needs improvement: Defensive when explaining FY23 EBITDA dip (restructuring cost) - should proactively address rather than waiting for question
- Good: Clear use of proceeds explanation
- Problem: Glosses over working capital build required for growth - this will definitely get investor questions

After presentation, team provides feedback:

MD: "Overall strong, but we need to tighten timing. You're at 42 minutes for what should be 25-minute presentation. CEO, suggest cutting market size detail in half. CTO, simplify technical language - remember audience is finance professionals, not engineers."

Director: "CFO, be more upfront about FY23 EBITDA impact. Don't wait for question, address it proactively: 'You'll notice FY23 EBITDA dipped slightly - this was one-off restructuring cost of AU\$2m, underlying business remained strong.' Much better to control narrative."

You contribute (junior voice, but encouraged to participate): "On slide 32 showing revenue growth forecast, might help to include brief explanation of growth drivers - new customer acquisition vs expansion of existing customers. Investors typically want to understand mix."

Management team takes notes, agrees to revise presentation and re-rehearse tomorrow.

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Start work on comparable company analysis for new pitch (mining company IPO):

Mining company exploring IPO in 6 months. Need preliminary valuation to discuss with management.

*Step 1 - Identify comparable companies*:
Search for ASX-listed gold mining companies with similar characteristics:
- Production: 150,000-300,000 oz per year (target company produces ~200,000 oz)
- Operating stage (not explorers, producing mines)
- Geographic location (Australia-focused preferred)

Identify peer group:
- Ramelius Resources (RMS)
- Westgold Resources (WGX)  
- Genesis Minerals (GMD)
- Capricorn Metals (CMM)
- Red 5 Limited (RED)

*Step 2 - Gather financial data*:
Extract from Bloomberg/FactSet/Capital IQ:
- Market cap, enterprise value
- Production (oz per year)
- AISC (all-in sustaining costs - key metric for mining)
- Reserves and resources (measured, indicated, inferred)
- FY24/25 EBITDA, revenue
- Trading multiples (EV/EBITDA, EV/Production, EV/Resource oz)

Start building Excel comp table but run out of time at 5pm. Will continue tomorrow morning.

*5:00pm - 6:00pm*: Due Diligence Committee meeting (Aurora IPO):

*Context*: The due diligence committee (DDC) is formal process to verify all statements in prospectus and identify/document risks. Critical for legal liability management - if prospectus contains misleading statements, directors and advisors can be liable. DDC meetings occur throughout transaction to systematically review business, financial, legal, and operational matters.

*Today's DDC Attendees*:
- Company: CEO, CFO, General Counsel
- Advisors: Corporate lawyers (lead counsel), corporate finance lawyers, investigating accountant (Big Four firm), tax advisors
- Boutique advisory: MD (leads), Director, Associate, You (note-taking)

*Meeting Structure* (lawyer chairs, goes through DDC agenda systematically):

*Item 1 - Financial Information Update*:
- Investigating accountant presents findings from financial due diligence
- Revenue recognition policies reviewed - satisfied they comply with AASB 15
- Working capital analysis complete - no red flags
- *Open item flagged*: Historical R&D tax incentive claims need ATO confirmation letter (required for prospectus disclosure)
- Action: CFO to request letter from ATO by next week

*Item 2 - Customer Contracts Review*:
- Lawyers reviewed top 20 customer contracts (representing 65% of revenue)
- Confirm contracts are legally binding, enforceable, no material breaches
- *Issue raised*: One major customer contract (12% of revenue) expires 2 months after IPO
- Discussion: Is this a material risk requiring disclosure? 
- Lawyer view: Yes, should disclose in risks section
- Company view: Customer has confirmed intent to renew but nothing in writing yet
- *Resolution*: Disclose as risk, company to get customer written renewal confirmation before roadshow

*Item 3 - Intellectual Property*:
- Lawyers confirm company owns all key IP (software code, trademarks, domain names)
- *Issue raised*: Some early code developed by contractors before formal IP assignment agreements in place
- Company has obtained retrospective IP assignments from contractors
- Lawyers comfortable this resolves issue, will disclose historical gap in risk factors

*Item 4 - Employee Matters*:
- 3 key employees on temporary work visas (critical technical staff)
- *Risk*: Visa renewals pending, if not approved could impact operations
- Company confident renewals will be approved (strong sponsorship track record)
- *Resolution*: Disclose as risk, company to expedite visa applications

*Your role in meeting*: 
- Taking detailed minutes documenting all discussions, issues raised, resolutions
- Recording action items and responsible parties
- Ensuring all open items tracked in DDC tracker spreadsheet
- After meeting, will circulate draft minutes to all attendees for review

*Why DDC matters*: This formal process creates documentary record showing all transaction parties conducted reasonable due diligence. If issues arise post-IPO (e.g., undisclosed customer contract risk materializes), DDC minutes demonstrate proper investigation occurred. Critical for "due diligence defense" against liability claims.

*Post-meeting* (5 minutes):
MD to you: "Good notes. Make sure the DDC tracker is updated tonight - we need clean record of all open items for lawyers. Customer contract renewal is biggest outstanding risk - flag that for close monitoring."

You spend 15 minutes updating DDC tracker:
- Item #47: ATO R&D tax incentive confirmation - Status: Open, Owner: CFO, Due: Dec 20
- Item #48: Major customer contract renewal - Status: Open (High Priority), Owner: CEO, Due: Before roadshow
- Item #49: Employee visa renewals - Status: In progress, Owner: General Counsel, Due: Jan 15

*6:00pm - 6:30pm*: Catch up on remaining emails and admin:
- Respond to emails (CFO Phoenix happy with dilution analysis, will discuss with Board)
- Update deal tracker showing Aurora and Phoenix status and next milestones
- File documents in deal folders (prospectus drafts, meeting notes, financial models)
- Review tomorrow's schedule: 9am Aurora presentation re-rehearsal, 11am call with ASIC on prospectus queries, 3pm Phoenix board presentation

*6:30pm - 7:30pm*: Continue working on Aurora investor Q&A preparation:

Anticipate tough investor questions and prepare suggested answers:

*Q: "Your customer concentration is high - top 5 customers are 42% of revenue. What happens if you lose one?"*
A: "We've been working with our top customers for 5+ years average, very sticky relationships. Switching costs are high given product integration. We're also diversifying - top 5 customer concentration was 48% two years ago, now 42%, trending down as we add new customers. No customer churned in past 3 years."

*Q: "Your cash burn is AU\$15m per year. How long does this IPO give you before you need to raise again?"*
A: "Post-IPO we'll have AU\$45m cash (AU\$30m IPO proceeds after costs, plus AU\$15m existing cash). We forecast reaching cash flow breakeven in FY26 (18 months away). AU\$45m cash provides 3+ years runway even if revenue growth slower than forecast. We won't need to access market again - this is the last capital raise."

*Q: "Why are insiders (PE fund, founders) selling 30% of their holdings? If this is such a great business, why are they selling?"*
A: "PE fund has held investment for 6 years, delivering strong returns for their investors - they have fund life requirements and need to return capital. They're retaining 45% stake post-IPO, remaining aligned with new investors. Founders selling small portion (15% of holdings) for diversification, but retaining 65% stake and all remain employed as executives - they're highly aligned with company's long-term success."

Draft 25 Q&A pairs covering business model, financials, valuation, risks, corporate governance. Will review with senior team tomorrow.

*7:30pm*: Head home. During peak deal periods (week before prospectus lodgement, roadshow week, pricing week), can work until 9-11pm or even all-nighters. Normal weeks are 8am-7pm. Weekends often required during live deals - Saturday/Sunday work common in ECM.

*Weekend work*: During Aurora roadshow next week, will work full weekend preparing daily investor feedback summaries, updating pricing indications, coordinating closing process. When not on live deal, weekends generally free.

== Conclusion

ECM roles at boutique advisory firms offer exceptional learning, direct exposure to major corporate transactions, and rapid career progression for high-performing individuals. The work combines rigorous financial analysis with strategic advisory and client relationship management.

Hours are demanding, particularly during live transactions, but the intellectual challenge, prestige, and exit opportunities make boutique ECM an excellent launching pad for careers in finance, private equity, or corporate leadership.
