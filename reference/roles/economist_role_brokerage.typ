= Economist Roles at Brokerage Firms

== Overview

Economists at brokerage firms provide macroeconomic analysis, forecasting, and market commentary that supports trading, sales, and client advisory activities. In Australia, major brokers like Morgans Financial, Bell Potter, Ord Minnett, and international firms like UBS and Macquarie maintain economics teams that produce research on domestic and global economic trends, monetary policy, fiscal developments, and their implications for financial markets.

Unlike academic or government economists who focus on policy design or theoretical research, brokerage economists translate economic developments into actionable investment insights for institutional and retail clients. Their work directly influences trading strategies, client positioning, and investment recommendations across asset classes.

This document outlines economist roles at Australian brokerage firms, from junior economists supporting research production through to chief economists setting the firm's macroeconomic view and representing the organisation externally.

=== A Day in the Life

*6:30am - 7:30am*: Early start to prepare for key economic release - ABS Labour Force data due at 11:30am. Review market expectations (consensus forecast from Bloomberg: 25k jobs added, unemployment steady at 4.1%), check recent forward indicators (job ads trending down, business surveys showing hiring intentions softening). Prepare pre-release note outlining what to watch: employment growth, participation rate changes, hours worked trends. Yesterday's US employment data came in strong - may influence RBA thinking on domestic labour market tightness.

*7:30am - 8:00am*: Check overnight developments - US Fed official gave hawkish speech, bond yields up 10bp, AUD weakened to 0.6420. Update morning briefing note for sales team with key overnight takeaways: Fed pushing back on rate cut expectations, market pricing now shows only 50bp of cuts in 2025 vs 75bp previously. Send to Chief Economist for quick review before 8am distribution to sales and trading desks.

*8:00am - 8:30am*: Morning meeting with sales and trading teams. Chief Economist presents overnight summary, highlights hawkish Fed tone and implications for global rates. You provide detail on upcoming Labour Force release - explain why you're expecting softer outcome (20k vs consensus 25k) based on leading indicators. Sales trader asks: "If we get strong employment number, will RBA hike next week?" Chief Economist responds that ship has sailed, but strong data reduces probability of near-term cuts. You take notes on client questions for potential follow-up research.

*8:30am - 10:30am*: Deep work session preparing for Labour Force release. Update labour market dashboard with latest leading indicators - job ads down 3.2% MoM from SEEK, NAB business survey shows hiring intentions weakening. Refine employment forecast model incorporating these indicators. Review statistical quirks in ABS methodology (seasonal adjustment can be volatile in January). Prepare quick-turnaround template for post-release note: headline employment change, unemployment rate, participation rate, underemployment, hours worked. Pre-write context paragraphs explaining recent trends so you can just drop in numbers when released.

*10:30am - 11:25am*: Final preparation. Review what RBA has said recently about labour market (last meeting statement emphasised "low unemployment", latest Governor speech flagged watching both employment growth AND hours worked). Check market pricing - OIS curve shows 15bp of RBA cuts priced for next 6 months. Call from Chief Economist: "Treasury released Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook while we were focused on jobs data - can you do quick assessment this afternoon?" You agree, add to task list.

*11:30am - 11:35am*: ABS releases Labour Force data. Employment up 56k (much stronger than expected!), unemployment rate falls to 4.0% (vs 4.1% expected), participation rate jumps to 67.1% (record high). Hours worked also strong. This is significantly better than consensus. Immediately start updating pre-written note.

*11:35am - 12:00pm*: Rapid analysis and writing. Drop actual numbers into template, assess implications: strong labour market continues, RBA unlikely to cut rates in near term, market will reprice. Notice interesting detail - full-time employment up 71k, part-time down 15k (compositional shift to full-time is positive quality signal). Include this insight. Check what's driving participation increase - both male and female participation at records. Write conclusion: labour market resilience exceeds expectations, supports RBA's cautious stance on rate cuts, reduces urgency for policy easing. Send draft to Chief Economist.

*12:00pm - 12:15pm*: Chief Economist calls - "Good catch on full-time/part-time split. Can you add sentence about wages implications? Strong labour market = wage pressure = inflation risk." You add: "Continued labour market strength likely to sustain wage growth around 4%, above RBA's comfort zone for returning inflation to target." Send revised note. Chief Economist approves, distributes to clients at 12:12pm (just 42 minutes after data release - very competitive timing).

*12:15pm - 1:00pm*: Market reaction happening in real-time. AUD jumps 30 pips to 0.6450, bond yields up 8bp, ASX 200 down 0.4% (rate cut expectations being pushed out hurts equities). Sales team forwarding client questions: "Does this mean RBA hiking again?" "When will first cut be now?" You help Chief Economist draft responses - no hikes likely, but first cut probably pushed to Q3 2025 vs Q2 previously expected. This is good trading flow - FX desk executing client AUD buy orders.

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Lunch while reviewing Treasury's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). Budget deficit revised up to \$28bn (vs \$14bn at Budget), largely due to weaker commodity prices and higher spending. Skim through 100+ page document, extract key numbers, assess implications. The fiscal deterioration is significant but not crisis level. Flag for Chief Economist that this may limit government's capacity for cost-of-living relief measures, which has inflation implications.

*2:00pm - 3:30pm*: Write MYEFO analysis note. Structure: 1) Budget bottom line deterioration, 2) Revenue weakness (commodity prices, weaker economy), 3) Spending increases (aged care, NDIS, infrastructure), 4) Forward estimates and debt trajectory, 5) Market implications. Key insight: fiscal policy no longer providing stimulus offset to monetary tightening - this actually helps RBA's inflation fight. Cross-check your fiscal multiplier estimates with recent RBA research papers to validate analysis. Complete draft.

*3:30pm - 4:00pm*: Meeting with Chief Economist to review MYEFO note. He pushes back on one point - you've written that fiscal deterioration is "concerning". He says be more neutral, focus on facts and market implications rather than normative judgments. Fair point - you're not Treasury, you're here to help clients understand market impact. Revise tone. Discuss distribution timing - he wants to send tomorrow morning as part of broader weekly economic outlook, alongside updated RBA rate forecasts incorporating today's strong labour market data.

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Update firm's economic forecasts. Strong labour market today means revising unemployment rate track (now bottoming at 3.9% vs previous 4.2%), adjusting RBA rate cut timing (first cut Q3 2025 vs Q2), tweaking GDP growth forecasts (stronger labour market supports consumption). Update forecast tables that get published in all economic research. Double-check all numbers - these forecasts get cited by sales team to clients constantly, accuracy is critical.

*5:00pm - 5:30pm*: Fixed income strategist drops by desk wanting to discuss bond market implications of today's data. She's writing piece on ACGB curve positioning. You discuss: strong labour market delays RBA cuts, supports front-end yields, steepens curve. She's thinking about recommending curve steepener trade (long 10-year, short 3-year). You flag that next week's CPI data is key risk - if inflation also comes in hot, front-end could sell off sharply. Good collaborative discussion, helps her refine trade recommendation.

*5:30pm - 6:00pm*: Prepare for tomorrow. Check calendar: NAB Business Survey (9:30am), Westpac Consumer Confidence (10:30am), need notes on both. US CPI tonight (important for Fed expectations, will affect global risk sentiment). Draft outline for weekly economic calendar note that goes to sales team Sunday evening. Review RBA Governor speech next Tuesday - need to prepare briefing for Chief Economist on what to listen for.

*Evening*: Leave around 6:30pm most days. Tonight take home reading - OECD Economic Outlook chapter on labour markets (relevant to understanding global trends), RBA research paper on wages and inflation (cited by Governor recently, important to understand their thinking).

== Conclusion

Economist roles at brokerage firms offer intellectually stimulating careers combining rigorous economic analysis with market application and client engagement. Unlike academic or government economics which focus on theoretical research or policy design, brokerage economists must translate complex economic developments into actionable investment insights under tight deadlines.

The Australian market provides excellent opportunities across boutique domestic brokers and major international investment banks. Success requires combining strong analytical skills with the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, work collaboratively across trading/sales/research functions, and maintain composure under the pressure of real-time market events.

For students considering this career path, building strong econometric and data analysis skills is essential. Practical experience through internships at brokers, central banks, or treasury departments is invaluable. Many successful brokerage economists start with Honours or Masters degrees in Economics, though some PhD economists also enter the field (particularly at major investment banks).

Career progression from Junior Economist to Chief Economist typically spans 8-12 years, with opportunities to specialize (fiscal policy, labour markets, international economics) or to transition to related roles (buy-side strategy, central bank, government, consultancy). The skills developed—rigorous analysis, clear communication, ability to synthesize vast information quickly, and understanding of market dynamics—are highly transferable across the financial services industry and broader economy.

The most successful brokerage economists combine technical excellence with market intuition, understanding that their ultimate value lies not just in getting forecasts right, but in helping clients navigate uncertainty and make informed investment decisions in real-time.
