== Overview: What Does a Financial Services Consultant Do?

Management consultants in Financial Services practices solve complex business problems for financial institutions through rigorous analysis, strategic recommendations, and implementation support. They work on projects ranging from growth strategy to cost reduction, digital transformation to risk management, regulatory response to M&A integration.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *Investment Banking Analyst*: Bankers advise on transactions (M&A, capital raising) and execute deals. Consultants advise on strategy, operations, and organizational issues without transaction execution.
- *Internal Strategy Team*: Internal strategists work for single financial institution on ongoing basis. Consultants work on discrete projects for multiple clients, bringing external perspective and cross-industry insights.
- *Actuarial Consultant*: Actuarial consultants provide specialized technical advice on insurance pricing, reserving, capital. Management consultants address broader business strategy and organizational challenges.
- *Technology Consultant*: Tech consultants focus on IT strategy and implementation. Management consultants address business strategy with technology as one component.
- *Audit/Assurance*: Auditors verify financial statements for compliance. Consultants solve strategic and operational business problems.

*Core Responsibilities of Financial Services Consultants:*

1. *Problem Solving*: Structuring complex business problems, developing analytical frameworks, generating insights from data
2. *Analysis*: Conducting quantitative and qualitative research, building financial models, analyzing market and competitive dynamics
3. *Client Service*: Working directly with senior client executives (CEOs, CFOs, Board members) to understand needs and deliver recommendations
4. *Strategy Development*: Formulating strategic recommendations on growth, market positioning, business model evolution
5. *Implementation Support*: Helping clients execute recommendations through change management, capability building, performance tracking
6. *Industry Expertise*: Developing deep understanding of financial services sectors (banking, insurance, asset management, fintech)
7. *Thought Leadership*: Contributing to firm's intellectual capital through research, publications, and knowledge development

*Work Environment:*

Consulting projects typically last 8-16 weeks, with teams of 3-6 consultants working on-site with clients or remotely. Work combines intensive analysis (data gathering, modelling, research) with client interaction (workshops, interviews, presentations) and internal collaboration (team meetings, quality reviews). Travel may be required depending on client location.

=== A Day in the Life: Business Analyst, Financial Services Practice, McKinsey (Sydney)

*Current Project*: 12-week engagement with major retail bank (Big Four) on digital channel strategy. Bank's digital app usage growing but still lagging competitors. Project goal: Develop strategy to accelerate digital adoption and reduce branch network costs.

*Project Team*:
- Partner (leads overall engagement, interfaces with CEO/Board)
- Engagement Manager (day-to-day project management, primary client contact with CIO/Digital Banking GM)
- Senior Associate (leads workstreams, manages team)
- You (Business Analyst, plus one other BA)

*8:30am - 9:00am*: Arrive at client site (bank's head office in Sydney CBD). Check emails:
- Engagement Manager wants draft slides on customer segmentation analysis for today's steering committee (3pm)
- Senior Associate sent feedback on yesterday's branch economics model - need revisions
- Client's Head of Channels wants to schedule interview this week to discuss branch strategy

Review today's priorities:
- Finalize customer segmentation analysis and create slides (due 1pm for review)
- Revise branch economics model per feedback
- Attend 2pm workshop on digital roadmap with product team
- Begin research on competitor digital capabilities for next week's analysis

*9:00am - 9:30am*: Daily team huddle in project team room at client site. Each person updates:
- You: Finishing customer segmentation today, slides by 1pm, will start competitor research this afternoon
- Other BA: Completing analysis of call center inquiry volumes, identifying opportunities to deflect calls to digital
- Senior Associate: Reviewing all materials for steering committee, conducting CEO interview this afternoon
- Engagement Manager: Client check-in with CIO at 10am, steering committee prep, partner flying in tonight for tomorrow's board presentation

Engagement Manager sets priorities: "Customer segmentation critical for steering committee - we're proposing to focus digital investment on high-value segments. Make sure slides tell clear story: which customers are digital-ready, what's economic value of shifting them to digital, what targeted interventions we recommend."

*9:30am - 12:00pm*: Finalize customer segmentation analysis and create presentation slides:

*Background*: Analyzed bank's 8 million customer database to understand digital adoption drivers and opportunities.

*Approach*: 
- Segmented customers into 6 groups based on: (1) current digital usage (active/inactive), (2) transaction volume, (3) product holdings, (4) profitability, (5) demographics (age, location)
- Key segments identified:
  - "Digital Natives" (1.2m customers, 15%): Under 35, high digital usage, moderate value
  - "Affluent Professionals" (800k, 10%): High income, high product holdings, some digital usage but still branch-reliant
  - "Mass Market Digital" (2.4m, 30%): Average demographics, growing digital usage, low-moderate value
  - "Branch Loyalists" (1.6m, 20%): Older, prefer branches, moderate value
  - "Inactive" (2.0m, 25%): Dormant accounts, minimal activity, low value

*Economic analysis*:
- Calculated cost-to-serve for each segment (digital channel AU\$5 per transaction, branch AU\$35, call center AU\$18)
- Identified "Affluent Professionals" as highest-priority segment: High lifetime value (AU\$1,200 annual profit per customer) but still using branches for 60% of transactions
- Opportunity: If shifted 50% of "Affluent Professional" branch transactions to digital, save AU\$8.4m annually in servicing costs

Create PowerPoint slides telling story:

*Slide 1: Customer base segmented into 6 distinct groups*
- Chart showing segments by size and profitability
- Callout highlighting "Affluent Professionals" as priority

*Slide 2: "Affluent Professionals" represent highest-value digital migration opportunity*
- Segment profile (800k customers, AU\$1,200 annual profit each, 60% branch usage)
- Economic prize if digital adoption increased

*Slide 3: Key barriers to digital adoption for "Affluent Professionals"*
- Based on customer survey and interviews:
  - Concerns about security (58% cite as barrier)
  - Preference for human advice on complex transactions (42%)
  - Poor digital experience for business/investment products (38%)
  - Habit/inertia (35%)

*Slide 4: Recommended interventions to accelerate digital adoption*
1. Enhanced security features and communications (biometrics, fraud alerts)
2. Digital advice tools for investments (robo-advisor capability)
3. Improved business banking digital features
4. Targeted incentives (fee waivers for digital transactions)
5. Proactive branch staff coaching customers to digital

*Slide 5: Financial impact - AU\$8.4m annual savings*
- Calculation showing servicing cost reduction
- Implementation timeline and investment required

Finish slides by 12pm. Send to Senior Associate for review with note: "Draft customer segmentation slides attached. Key message: Target 'Affluent Professionals' segment with tailored digital interventions, AU\$8.4m savings opportunity. Happy to revise based on feedback."

*12:00pm - 12:30pm*: Grab quick lunch at nearby café with other BA. Discuss project challenges, share learnings from other engagements, decompress. Consulting culture emphasizes team bonding - helps when working long hours together.

*12:30pm - 2:00pm*: Revise branch economics model based on Senior Associate feedback:

*Original model*: Calculated P&L for each branch location to identify closure candidates.

*Feedback*: "Model looks good but needs more nuance on customer reassignment. When we close branch, where do customers go? How many switch to digital vs transfer to nearby branch vs leave bank entirely? Need to model customer attrition impact on economics."

*Revisions*:
- Add customer behavior assumptions based on industry research:
  - 40% of displaced customers switch to digital (low cost)
  - 35% transfer to next-nearest branch (increases traffic/costs at remaining branches)
  - 25% attrite to competitors (lose customer lifetime value)
- Model shows closing 50 branches:
  - Gross savings: AU\$35m (branch operating costs)
  - Increased costs at remaining branches: AU\$8m (35% of customers transfer)
  - Lost customer value: AU\$12m (25% attrition × average lifetime value)
  - Net savings: AU\$15m (AU\$35m - AU\$8m - AU\$12m)
- Much less attractive than gross savings suggested!

Key insight: Can't just close branches and assume customers stay - need digital migration strategy first to minimize attrition.

Email revised model to Senior Associate with summary of findings.

*2:00pm - 3:30pm*: Attend workshop with client's digital product team (15 people - product managers, UX designers, developers):

*Workshop objective*: Co-develop 18-month digital roadmap prioritizing feature development.

Engagement Manager facilitates. Your role: Take detailed notes, capture ideas, observe dynamics.

*Discussion highlights*:
- Product team frustrated: "We know what features customers want (better bill pay, personal finance management tools, instant payments) but IT delivery is too slow. Takes 12 months to launch anything."
- Debate over priorities: Should we focus on improving existing app features (faster, more reliable) vs adding new capabilities?
- Engagement Manager pushes: "What's ROI on each feature? Which drive most customer adoption and engagement?"
- Team admits they don't have robust data on feature usage and customer impact

You note potential next phase of work: Help bank build digital product analytics capability and agile delivery model.

Workshop concludes with draft roadmap:
- Phase 1 (0-6 months): Fix performance issues, improve core banking features
- Phase 2 (6-12 months): Launch personal finance management tools
- Phase 3 (12-18 months): Add investment/wealth management features

Team agrees to socialize with IT and get delivery feasibility assessment.

*3:30pm - 5:00pm*: Begin competitor digital capability research for next week's analysis:

*Assignment*: Benchmark bank's digital app against competitors on key features and customer experience.

*Approach*:
- Download and test competitor apps (CBA, NAB, ANZ, Westpac, plus neobanks like Up, 86 400)
- Create feature comparison matrix showing what each offers
- Review customer ratings and reviews (App Store, Google Play, ProductReview.com)
- Research industry reports on digital banking leaders

*Initial findings* (will complete tomorrow):
- CBA CommBank app rated #1 (4.7 stars, excellent UX, comprehensive features)
- Client's bank app rated 3.8 stars (main complaints: slow, clunky design, limited features)
- Neobanks (Up, 86 400) rated highly on UX but limited product range
- Client is lagging on: mobile check deposit, real-time transaction categorization, savings goals, instant payments

Create draft comparison table for team review tomorrow. This will support recommendation to invest in UX redesign and feature parity.

*5:00pm - 6:00pm*: Prepare for tomorrow's client interviews:

*Scheduled*: 2 interviews with branch managers (9am and 11am) to understand frontline perspective on digital adoption challenges.

*Prep work*:
- Review interview guide prepared by Senior Associate
- Research branches being interviewed (locations, customer demographics, performance)
- Prepare note-taking template to capture responses systematically
- Brief context: Branch managers often resistant to digital push (threatens their roles) - need to manage sensitively while gathering honest feedback

Review questions:
1. How do you currently coach customers to use digital channels?
2. What barriers do customers cite for not adopting digital?
3. What digital features would make your job easier?
4. How do you feel about potential branch consolidation?

Ready for tomorrow's interviews.

*6:00pm - 7:00pm*: Team working session reviewing all materials for steering committee (happening now in parallel):

Engagement Manager, Senior Associate, and Partner (arrived from Melbourne) reviewing slides.

Partner provides feedback on customer segmentation: "Good analysis but recommendation not crisp enough. Don't say 'improve security features' - say exactly what security features and when we recommend implementing. Need specificity for client to action."

Team works together to sharpen recommendations:
- From: "Enhanced security features" 
- To: "Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint/Face ID) by Q2 2026, launch fraud alert SMS/push notifications by Q3 2026, partner with security firm to develop educational campaign addressing customer concerns"

Partner satisfied: "Much better. Specific, actionable, timeline. This is what CEO wants to see."

You observe and learn what "McKinsey-quality" recommendations look like - not fluffy strategy, but concrete action plans.

*7:00pm - 7:30pm*: Wrap up for day:
- Update personal task tracker (customer segmentation complete ✓, branch model revised ✓, competitor research 50% complete, interview prep done ✓)
- Email engagement manager with status update
- File all work in shared project folder
- Review tomorrow's calendar: 9am and 11am interviews, 3pm team meeting, evening work session likely

*7:30pm*: Head home. Typical consulting hours are 8:30am-7:30/8pm during project weeks. During intense periods (pre-client presentation, final deliverable week) can extend to 9-11pm for 1-2 weeks. Weekend work depends on deadlines - some weekends free, some require Saturday/Sunday work.

*Evening*: Optional professional development - reading HBR article on digital transformation in financial services to deepen industry knowledge. Many consultants pursue MBA or industry certifications (CFA for financial services practice) to advance careers.
