== Overview: What Does a Market Analyst at an Economics Consultancy Do?

Market analysts at economics consultancies (such as Frontier Economics, NERA Economic Consulting, Deloitte Access Economics, The Brattle Group) apply economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze markets, competition, regulation, and policy. In the energy sector specifically, they develop sophisticated models of electricity markets, price forecasting, and investment analysis to support clients including energy companies, regulators, infrastructure investors, and government.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *Energy Trader*: Traders execute transactions in energy markets for profit. Analysts model market fundamentals and price dynamics to advise clients on strategy and investment, without trading execution.
- *Management Consultant*: Management consultants address broad business strategy and operations. Economics consultants provide specialized economic and quantitative analysis, often for regulatory proceedings and litigation.
- *Academic Economist*: Academics conduct theoretical research for publication. Economics consultants apply economic methods to real-world commercial and policy problems for paying clients.
- *Data Scientist*: Data scientists build predictive models across various domains. Economics consultants apply economic theory to ensure models reflect market fundamentals and economic behavior.
- *Investment Analyst*: Investment analysts evaluate securities for portfolio decisions. Economics consultants assess market structures, regulatory frameworks, and long-term industry dynamics.
- *Government Policy Analyst*: Government analysts develop policy for single agency. Economics consultants provide independent advice to multiple clients (government, private sector, industry groups).

*Core Responsibilities of Market Analysts (Energy/Electricity Focus):*

1. *Electricity Price Modelling*: Building quantitative models to forecast wholesale electricity prices based on supply/demand fundamentals, fuel costs, network constraints, and policy settings
2. *Market Analysis*: Analyzing electricity market structures, competition dynamics, generation investment, and market efficiency
3. *Regulatory Analysis*: Assessing impact of regulatory changes (e.g., network pricing, renewable energy targets, carbon pricing) on markets and participants
4. *Project Economics*: Evaluating commercial viability of energy projects (power plants, renewable developments, storage) under different market scenarios
5. *Expert Testimony*: Supporting expert witnesses in regulatory proceedings, competition matters, and litigation with economic analysis
6. *Policy Evaluation*: Assessing economic impacts of energy and climate policies using cost-benefit analysis and modelling
7. *Client Advisory*: Advising energy companies, infrastructure investors, and government on market strategy and investment decisions
8. *Research & Thought Leadership*: Contributing to firm's intellectual capital through white papers, conference presentations, and publications

*Work Environment:*

Economics consultancies operate on project-based model with small teams (2-5 people) working on multiple concurrent engagements. Work combines intensive quantitative modelling (Excel, Python, R, specialized software) with economic research, client interaction, and written deliverables. Projects range from 2 weeks (small analysis) to 6+ months (major regulatory submissions). The role requires balancing analytical depth with commercial pragmatism and tight deadlines.

=== A Day in the Life: Analyst, Energy Practice, Frontier Economics (Melbourne)

*Current Projects*:
1. *Victorian Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) Analysis* - Modelling electricity prices and investment patterns under proposed REZ framework for state government (8-week project, midway through)
2. *Battery Storage Project Evaluation* - Assessing commercial viability of 300MW battery project for infrastructure investor (4-week project, final week)
3. *NEM Renewable Integration Study* - Analyzing system costs of high renewable penetration for industry association (12-week project, just started)

*8:30am - 9:00am*: Arrive at office. Check emails:
- Senior Consultant sent feedback on yesterday's battery storage revenue analysis - needs revisions
- AEMO published updated demand forecasts - need to download and incorporate into REZ modelling
- Client (infrastructure investor) wants call at 2pm to discuss preliminary battery results

Review today's priorities:
- Revise battery storage revenue model per feedback
- Update REZ dispatch model with new AEMO demand forecasts
- Run REZ scenarios for tomorrow's client workshop
- Prepare materials for battery storage client call

*9:00am - 9:30am*: Daily team meeting (energy practice has ~12 people - 2 partners, 3 senior consultants, 7 analysts/consultants):
- Quick round-table updates on active projects
- Partner mentions new project pipeline - energy company seeking advice on transmission access arrangements (potential new work)
- Discussion of upcoming industry conference - several team members presenting papers
- Technical discussion: Another analyst working on similar battery storage project shares approach to modelling arbitrage revenues

*9:30am - 11:30am*: Revise battery storage revenue model based on Senior Consultant feedback:

*Project background*: Infrastructure investor evaluating AU\$180m investment in 300MW/600MWh battery storage facility in South Australia. Needs revenue forecast to support investment decision.

*Revenue sources modelled*:
1. Energy arbitrage (charge during low prices, discharge during high prices)
2. FCAS (Frequency Control Ancillary Services) markets
3. Network support services (defer transmission upgrades)
4. Wholesale demand response (paid to reduce charging during peak demand)

*Feedback received*: "Revenue model looks reasonable but battery degradation assumptions too conservative. Industry data shows newer lithium-ion batteries maintain 80%+ capacity after 10 years with proper management. Also need to model risk of FCAS price suppression as more batteries enter market - current FCAS prices ~AU\$15/MW/hr may fall to AU\$8-10/MW/hr as supply increases."

*Revisions*:

*1. Update battery degradation curve*:
- Old assumption: Linear degradation to 70% capacity after 10 years
- New assumption: 85% capacity after 10 years, 80% after 15 years (based on Bloomberg NEF battery performance data)
- Impact: Higher energy throughput over asset life → higher revenue

*2. Model FCAS price decline scenario*:
- Historical FCAS prices in South Australia: AU\$12-18/MW/hr average
- Current model assumes AU\$15/MW/hr constant
- Create three scenarios:
  - Base case: Gradual decline from AU\$15 to AU\$10/MW/hr over 5 years (as battery supply increases)
  - Bull case: Prices stay elevated at AU\$13-15/MW/hr (limited new battery entry)
  - Bear case: Sharp decline to AU\$8/MW/hr within 3 years (aggressive battery deployment)

*Revenue results* (NPV over 15-year life, 8% discount rate):
- Energy arbitrage: AU\$85m (unchanged)
- FCAS services:
  - Bull case: AU\$92m
  - Base case: AU\$65m (down from AU\$88m in original model)
  - Bear case: AU\$48m
- Network services: AU\$25m (contract with ElectraNet)
- Total NPV:
  - Bull case: AU\$202m (healthy return on AU\$180m investment)
  - Base case: AU\$175m (marginal return)
  - Bear case: AU\$158m (negative return)

Key finding: Investment viability highly sensitive to FCAS price trajectory. Recommend client focus on securing network services contracts to reduce revenue risk.

Update Excel model, create new scenario summary table, draft one-page memo explaining revisions for client call this afternoon.

*11:30am - 12:00pm*: Download and process new AEMO demand forecasts for REZ modelling:

AEMO just released updated Victorian electricity demand forecasts in their 2024 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO).

*Key changes*:
- 2030 peak demand revised down from 11,200 MW to 10,800 MW (lower than previous forecast due to rooftop solar and energy efficiency)
- 2030 minimum demand (operational) revised to 2,100 MW (down from 2,500 MW) - this is critical for renewable integration
- Underlying demand flat to 2035, then growing due to electrification of transport and heating

Download AEMO data tables, extract demand forecasts by scenario (slow change, step change, hydrogen superpower), import into Python to process and format for electricity dispatch model (using PLEXOS software).

Note: Lower minimum demand creates challenges for integrating large-scale renewables - during sunny/windy periods with low demand, need more flexibility (storage, demand response, interconnectors) to avoid curtailment.

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch with colleagues at nearby café. Discussion ranges from project challenges to energy policy debate (federal government's Capacity Investment Scheme, state renewable energy targets). Economics consultancies attract people passionate about policy - lunch conversations often substantive.

*1:00pm - 3:00pm*: Run Victorian REZ dispatch modelling scenarios:

*Project context*: Victorian government proposing Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) - designated regions with strong renewable resources where transmission infrastructure will be built to enable large-scale renewable development. Need to model electricity market outcomes under different REZ deployment pathways.

*Model setup* (using PLEXOS electricity dispatch modelling software):
- Geographic scope: National Electricity Market (5 states)
- Time horizon: 2025-2040 (15 years)
- Temporal resolution: Half-hourly dispatch (17,520 periods per year)
- Generator portfolio: All existing generators plus committed projects, plus potential REZ renewable projects
- Transmission network: Existing interconnectors plus proposed REZ transmission augmentations
- Demand: AEMO forecasts (just updated with new data)
- Fuel prices: Gas (forecast from futures market), coal (declining as mines close), zero cost for wind/solar

*Scenarios to model*:
1. *Business as Usual*: No REZ policy, renewables develop organically
2. *REZ Policy - Staged*: REZs built incrementally 2025-2035
3. *REZ Policy - Accelerated*: Aggressive REZ build 2025-2030

For each scenario, model outputs:
- Wholesale electricity prices (time-weighted average for Victoria)
- Generation mix and capacity additions
- Renewable energy generation and curtailment
- Transmission utilization and congestion
- Total system costs

*Running scenarios*:

Launch PLEXOS model for Scenario 2 (REZ Staged):
- Input: 6 GW of new wind/solar capacity in REZs by 2030, 12 GW by 2035
- Transmission: New 500 kV lines connecting REZ regions to load centers
- Model run time: 45 minutes for full 15-year simulation

While model runs, review assumptions document to ensure all inputs defensible and transparent.

*Results* (Scenario 2 - REZ Staged):
- Victorian average wholesale price 2030: AU\$72/MWh (vs AU\$85/MWh in Business as Usual)
- Renewable generation share 2030: 78% (vs 68% in BAU)
- Curtailment of renewables: 3.2% of potential generation (manageable with increased transmission)
- Total system cost saving 2025-2040: AU\$3.8bn NPV (lower wholesale costs, though partially offset by transmission investment)

Price decline driven by: (1) More renewable capacity (low marginal cost), (2) Better transmission reducing congestion premiums.

Launch Scenario 3 (REZ Accelerated) to run overnight - will review results tomorrow.

Capture key results in summary spreadsheet for tomorrow's client workshop.

*3:00pm - 4:00pm*: Break to prepare for client call, then call with infrastructure investor on battery storage project:

*Attendees*: 
- Client: Head of Infrastructure Investments, Senior Analyst
- Frontier team: Senior Consultant (leads), you (supporting)

*Discussion*:

Senior Consultant presents revised revenue analysis:
- "We've updated battery degradation assumptions based on latest industry data - better performance than initially modelled"
- "However, we see material risk to FCAS revenues as more batteries enter market. Our base case shows FCAS prices declining from current AU\$15/MW/hr to AU\$10/MW/hr by 2030"
- "This creates headwinds for investment returns - base case NPV of AU\$175m vs AU\$180m investment cost, ~10% IRR"

Client asks: "What can we do to improve economics? Are there additional revenue streams we haven't considered?"

You contribute (prepared this morning): "A few opportunities: (1) Contract with network operator ElectraNet for network support services - we modelled AU\$25m NPV but there may be scope for higher contracted payments if battery provides firm capacity; (2) Participate in SA government's Grid Scale Storage Fund which provides subsidies/revenue support; (3) Explore long-term offtake agreement with large customer (e.g., data center) for reliability services"

Senior Consultant adds: "Also worth noting risk-mitigation strategies: (1) Stage deployment - build 150 MW first, assess market, then decide on second 150 MW; (2) Design flexibility for multiple use cases beyond FCAS; (3) Monitor regulatory developments - there may be new revenue streams from emerging frequency services"

Client appreciative: "This is helpful analysis. Can you model the impact of ElectraNet network contract at AU\$35m vs AU\$25m? And provide more detail on SA Grid Scale Storage Fund eligibility?"

Team agrees to provide supplementary analysis by end of week.

*4:00pm - 5:30pm*: Draft preliminary findings memo for REZ project ahead of tomorrow's workshop:

Tomorrow: Half-day workshop with Victorian government stakeholders (Department of Energy, Treasury, policy advisors) to present preliminary modelling results and discuss policy design.

*Memo structure*:

*Executive Summary*:
- REZ policy accelerates renewable deployment and reduces wholesale electricity prices
- Staged REZ approach (Scenario 2) delivers AU\$3.8bn system cost savings vs Business as Usual
- Accelerated REZ (Scenario 3) delivers higher short-term price reductions but requires significant upfront transmission investment
- Recommend Staged approach with flexibility to accelerate if economics improve

*Key Findings*:
1. Price impacts: REZ policy reduces Vic average wholesale price to AU\$72/MWh by 2030 (vs AU\$85/MWh BAU)
2. Renewable integration: 78% renewable generation achievable with manageable curtailment (3.2%)
3. Transmission requirements: New 500 kV transmission critical to unlock REZ potential
4. System reliability: Adequate capacity margins maintained through firming arrangements

*Policy Considerations*:
- Transmission funding mechanism critical (regulated asset base vs government funding?)
- Coordination with Commonwealth Capacity Investment Scheme important
- Need for complementary policies: storage, demand flexibility, interconnectors

*Next Steps*:
- Finalize Scenario 3 modelling (accelerated REZ)
- Sensitivity analysis on key assumptions (gas prices, demand forecasts, technology costs)
- Develop implementation roadmap

Draft 5-page memo, send to Senior Consultant for review before tomorrow's workshop.

*5:30pm - 6:00pm*: Catch up on emails and admin:
- Respond to colleague's question about battery degradation data sources
- Update project time tracking (allocate hours across three active projects)
- File today's model runs and outputs in organized project folders
- Review tomorrow's schedule: 9am-12pm client workshop (REZ project), afternoon continue NEM renewable integration work

*6:00pm*: Head home. Typical hours for economics consultancy analysts are 8:30am-6pm to 6:30pm. During major regulatory submissions or client deadlines, can extend to 7:30-8:30pm for 1-2 weeks. Weekend work occasionally required for urgent client requests or submission deadlines but less frequent than management consulting or investment banking. Generally good work-life balance while doing intellectually challenging, impactful work.

*Evening*: Optional professional development - reading recently published paper on electricity market design with high renewable penetration (from Energy Economics journal). Many analysts pursue postgraduate studies part-time (Masters in Economics, PhD) to deepen expertise. Some study for CFA to understand financial analysis alongside economic analysis.
