*7:45am - 8:30am*: CSL announces results – beat on revenue, miss on margins due to plasma collection costs. Stock down 3% pre-market. Quickly update model with actual results, assess materiality of margin miss. Write initial assessment for PM: short-term margin pressure but doesn't change long-term thesis on plasma demand growth and pricing power.

*8:30am - 9:30am*: Listen to CSL management call. CEO and CFO discuss plasma collection strategy – increasing donor fees to rebuild collection network post-COVID. Your question to CFO: "Can you quantify the margin headwind from collection costs and when do you expect normalisation?" CFO guides to 12-18 month timeline for margin recovery. This confirms your view – temporary issue, not structural.

*9:30am - 10:30am*: Call with Portfolio Manager to discuss CSL position. You recommend holding position despite near-term margin pressure – thesis remains intact on long-term plasma shortage, new product pipeline looks strong, valuation now more attractive after today's sell-off. PM agrees, suggests potentially adding if stock weakens further.

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch meeting with industry expert consultant – former Cochlear executive now advising hearing aid manufacturers. Deep discussion on cochlear implant technology roadmap, bilateral implant trends, pricing dynamics across markets. Paid consultation arranged through compliance-approved channel. Valuable insights for refining Cochlear thesis.

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Write up detailed meeting notes from ResMed and Cochlear consultant calls. Key insight: GLP-1 weight loss drugs potentially reducing sleep apnea prevalence (negative for ResMed, CPR Sleep) but timeline uncertain. Flag this as emerging risk to monitor. Update internal research notes, share relevant points with PM.

*2:00pm - 3:30pm*: Work on major investment paper recommending new position in Ramsay Health Care. You've been building this thesis for 3 months – structural healthcare demand from aging population, underappreciated international growth potential, valuation compelling after 2-year de-rating. Draft executive summary, refine financial model, prepare risk factors section.

*3:30pm - 4:30pm*: Investment Committee presentation on existing large-cap holding (CSL). Present updated view post-results: maintain position, thesis intact, margin pressure temporary, valuation attractive at 26x forward PE vs 5-year average of 30x. Handle questions from PM and other sector analysts. Committee agrees to hold position, approved to add on further weakness.

*4:30pm - 5:30pm*: Mentoring session with junior analyst. Review their Sonic Healthcare model and investment thesis.

*9:00am - 10:00am*: Series of calls with Portfolio Managers managing different strategies. Present sector view: margin pressure likely sector-wide, not ANZ-specific. Deposit pricing competition intensifying as RBA hiking cycle matures. Recommend reducing overweight position in banks, moving some capital to insurance stocks where pricing dynamics more favourable.

Hypothesis: branch networks becoming obsolete, digital banking reducing costs but commoditising relationships, wealth management integration critical for customer retention. This could have major implications for sector positioning (positive for CBA with best digital platform, negative for branch-heavy regional banks). Draft framework and outline.

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Investment Committee meeting. Present sector positioning update in light of ANZ margin guidance.
