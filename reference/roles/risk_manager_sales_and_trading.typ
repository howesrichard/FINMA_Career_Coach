== Overview: What Does a Sales & Trading Risk Manager Do?

Risk managers in Sales & Trading divisions provide independent oversight of trading activities, measuring and monitoring market risk, credit risk, and operational risk arising from trading operations. They work closely with trading desks while maintaining independence, ensuring the bank operates within risk limits, regulatory requirements, and board-approved risk appetite.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *Trader*: Traders take risk for profit. Risk managers monitor and control risk-taking, acting as independent check on trading activities.
- *Quantitative Analyst*: Quants build pricing models for trading. Risk managers validate those models, measure risk using them, and ensure they're fit for purpose.
- *Middle Office Operations*: Operations focuses on trade processing, settlements, and reconciliation. Risk managers focus on risk measurement, limit monitoring, and risk reporting.
- *Compliance*: Compliance ensures adherence to regulations and policies. Risk managers focus specifically on quantitative risk metrics (VaR, stress testing, exposure limits).
- *Auditor*: Auditors periodically review controls. Risk managers provide ongoing, daily risk monitoring and management.

*Core Responsibilities of S&T Risk Managers:*

1. *Market Risk Measurement*: Calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR), stress testing, scenario analysis, and sensitivity metrics (Greeks) for trading portfolios
2. *Limit Monitoring*: Tracking trading positions against approved limits (VaR limits, position limits, loss limits, concentration limits)
3. *Risk Reporting*: Producing daily, weekly, and monthly risk reports for traders, senior management, board risk committee
4. *Model Validation*: Reviewing and challenging pricing models, risk models, and trading algorithms developed by quants
5. *Regulatory Compliance*: Ensuring risk management meets APRA prudential standards, Basel III capital requirements, FRTB framework
6. *Risk Analysis*: Investigating limit breaches, unusual P&L movements, large positions, and emerging risks
7. *Stress Testing*: Designing and running stress scenarios to assess portfolio resilience under extreme market conditions
8. *Backtesting*: Validating risk models by comparing predictions to actual outcomes

*Work Environment:*

Risk teams typically sit on or near trading floor but maintain independence from trading management. Work combines quantitative analysis (coding, modeling, data analysis) with stakeholder management (challenging traders, reporting to executives) and regulatory engagement. Risk managers must balance being business partners (enabling trading) with being independent gatekeepers (preventing excessive risk).

=== A Day in the Life: Junior Risk Analyst, Market Risk, Global Bank (Sydney)

*6:30am - 7:30am*: Arrive early to prepare daily risk report before trading opens. Your desk covers Australian rates and credit trading operations.

*Morning routine*:
1. Extract overnight positions from trading system (Murex) and data warehouse
2. Reconcile position data with yesterday's closing positions - identify breaks
3. Run VaR calculation (using historical simulation, 1-day 99% VaR)
4. Run stress tests (RBA rate shock, credit spread widening, equity market crash scenarios)
5. Calculate Greek sensitivities for options book (delta, gamma, vega, theta)
6. Check all positions against approved limits
7. Investigate any limit breaches overnight

*Today's results*:
- Rates desk VaR: AU\$3.2m (limit AU\$5m, 64% utilized)
- Credit desk VaR: AU\$2.8m (limit AU\$3.5m, 80% utilized)
- Combined VaR: AU\$5.1m (limit AU\$7m, 73% utilized - diversification benefit)
- Stress test: AU\$8.5m loss under RBA +100bp rate shock (limit AU\$12m)

*Issue identified*: Credit desk has AU\$450m position in Australian bank senior bonds (CBA, NAB, ANZ, WBC). Concentration limit for single sector is AU\$400m → AU\$50m breach.

Call credit trader (7:15am): "Morning, just flagging you're AU\$50m over on financial sector concentration limit. Can you reduce today?"

Trader responds: "Thanks for heads up. We executed client trades yesterday afternoon, didn't realize we breached. Will reduce position this morning - planning to sell AU\$100m CBA bonds to super fund. Should be back within limit by 10am."

You: "Perfect, I'll note that in the breach log. Please confirm once trades executed so I can update report."

*7:30am - 8:00am*: Finalize daily risk report and distribute via email to:
- Trading desk heads
- Head of Markets
- Chief Risk Officer
- CEO (summary only)
- Board Risk Committee (for monthly pack)

*Report contents*:
- VaR by desk and aggregate
- Limit utilization dashboard
- Stress test results
- Limit breaches and resolutions
- Large position report (positions >AU\$200m notional)
- Week-over-week VaR trends

Send report by 7:45am (required by 8am for management review before markets open).

*8:00am - 8:30am*: Daily risk meeting with trading desk heads and middle office.

*Attendees*: Head of Rates Trading, Head of Credit Trading, Head of FX Trading, Market Risk Manager (your boss), you (taking notes).

*Discussion*:
- You present overnight VaR and stress results
- Flag credit desk concentration breach - trader confirms resolution in progress
- Rates trader asks: "Can we increase our rates volatility limit? Current AU\$2m vega limit constraining client business - we're turning away option trades."
- Market Risk Manager: "What's your case? What client demand are you seeing?"
- Rates trader explains: "Super funds want to buy receiver swaptions (volatility on rate cuts). We can't take other side of trade without more vega capacity. Could increase vega limit to AU\$3m?"
- Market Risk Manager: "I'll need formal request with expected P&L, risk metrics, market rationale. Submit by end of week, we'll review and escalate to CRO if appropriate."

Meeting concludes. You note action item: "Rates desk to submit vega limit increase request by Friday."

*8:30am - 10:00am*: Model backtesting work (quarterly requirement).

*Task*: Backtest VaR model to validate accuracy. Regulatory requirement: VaR should be exceeded no more than 1% of days over trailing year (~2-3 breaches in 250 trading days acceptable).

*Analysis*:
- Extract past 250 days of VaR forecasts and actual P&L
- Count days where actual loss exceeded VaR forecast
- Result: 3 breaches over 250 days (1.2% breach rate - acceptable)
- All 3 breaches occurred during March 2024 volatility event (SVB crisis fallout)
- Largest breach: VaR predicted AU\$5.2m max loss, actual loss was AU\$6.8m (30% exceedance)

Document findings in backtesting report:
- VaR model performing within acceptable range
- Breaches concentrated during extreme volatility period (expected behavior)
- No recalibration needed at this time
- Recommendation: Continue quarterly monitoring

Save report for model validation team and regulatory filing.

*10:00am - 11:00am*: FX options risk analysis (ad-hoc request from Head of FX Trading).

*Background*: FX desk sold large AUD/USD call option to corporate client (AU\$200m notional, 6-month expiry, strike 0.6600). Desk is short gamma and needs to delta hedge by trading spot FX as AUD/USD moves.

*Trader's question*: "Can you model our delta hedging costs under different volatility scenarios? Want to understand P&L risk from gamma hedging."

*Your analysis*:
Build Monte Carlo simulation in Python:
- Model AUD/USD paths using stochastic volatility (current realized vol 10%, implied vol 12%)
- Simulate delta hedging frequency (daily rebalancing)
- Calculate transaction costs (1bp bid-offer spread on spot FX trades)
- Run 10,000 scenarios

*Results*:
- Expected hedging cost: AU\$120,000 (0.06% of notional)
- 95th percentile hedging cost: AU\$280,000 (if vol spikes to 18%)
- 99th percentile hedging cost: AU\$450,000 (extreme scenario)

Present findings to trader: "In most scenarios, your hedging costs are AU\$100-150k. But if we see volatility spike like we did in March 2024, costs could reach AU\$450k. You might want to buy vega hedge (buy volatility) to offset this gamma risk."

Trader: "Good analysis. I'll discuss with structuring team about vega hedge options. Thanks."

*11:00am - 12:00pm*: Participate in weekly model validation meeting.

*Meeting*: Independent Model Validation team reviews new interest rate derivatives pricing model developed by quants.

*Model purpose*: Price exotic interest rate options (callable swaps, range accruals, LIBOR-in-arrears swaps).

*Validation team findings*:
- Model mathematics sound (based on LIBOR Market Model)
- Calibration to market swaption prices works well
- Documentation comprehensive and clear

*Issues raised*:
1. Model assumes continuous delta hedging (not realistic - traders rehedge discretely)
2. Limited testing on extreme parameter inputs
3. No analysis of model behavior during negative interest rates

*Your role*: As market risk, you add perspective: "From risk measurement standpoint, we need to understand model behavior in stress scenarios. Can you test model with rates at -1% or +8%? Want to ensure VaR calculations stable under extreme inputs."

Validation team agrees to add stress testing to validation scope. Model approved for use pending resolution of issues within 30 days.

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch at desk while working on stress testing project.

*Project*: Enhance stress testing framework to include climate risk scenarios (regulatory requirement from APRA climate guidance).

*Task*: Design stress scenario for "transition risk" - sharp increase in carbon prices impacts credit spreads of emissions-intensive corporates.

Research and draft scenario:
- Assumption: Carbon price increases from AU\$35/tonne to AU\$150/tonne over 12 months
- Impact: Energy, airlines, materials sectors see credit spreads widen 50-100bp
- Model portfolio impact: Credit desk has AU\$800m exposure to these sectors
- Estimated loss: AU\$12-15m (combining spread widening and potential rating downgrades)

Document scenario design for senior risk manager review. This will be incorporated into quarterly stress testing framework.

*1:00pm - 3:00pm*: Limit monitoring and analysis.

*Task*: Review limit framework for FX trading desk ahead of quarterly limit review meeting next month.

*Analysis*:
- Current FX desk limits: VaR AU\$4m, Spot FX position AU\$500m, Options vega AU\$1.5m
- Historical utilization: VaR averages 65%, rarely exceeds 80%
- Business growth: FX trading revenue up 25% YoY, client flows increasing
- Traders requesting limit increases to support growth

*Your assessment*:
- VaR limit appears adequate (headroom available for growth)
- Spot FX position limit frequently hits 90-95% utilization → recommend increase to AU\$600m
- Options vega limit adequate for current business

Draft memo recommending AU\$100m increase in spot FX position limit, including supporting analysis of historical utilization, business rationale, and risk assessment. Send to Market Risk Manager for review.

*3:00pm - 4:00pm*: Investigate unusual P&L movement.

*Issue flagged*: Credit desk reported AU\$850k gain yesterday but you calculated VaR only showed AU\$200k daily volatility. P&L movement 4x larger than VaR suggested.

*Investigation*:
1. Review trading activity - desk executed large corporate bond trade with super fund client
2. Check pricing: Bond trade priced at 101.50, market was 101.20 → 30bp premium
3. Speak with trader: "We negotiated premium pricing because client wanted immediate execution on AU\$300m block. This was one-time event, not daily market volatility."
4. Conclusion: P&L within normal range for large client facilitation trade, not a model issue

Document investigation in daily risk commentary. Flag to senior risk manager that this type of "jumbo trade" P&L can exceed VaR (which measures market risk, not execution risk).

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Regulatory reporting preparation.

*Task*: Compile monthly market risk report for APRA reporting (APS 180 - Capital Adequacy: Market Risk).

*Report includes*:
- Trading book capital requirements calculated using internal models approach (IMA)
- VaR and stressed VaR (VaR calculated using historical data from 2008-09 crisis)
- Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) for credit migration and default risk
- Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM) for correlation trading book
- Backtesting results and model validation status

Compile data from past month, format into APRA-required template, perform quality checks. Submit to senior risk manager for review before filing deadline.

*5:00pm - 6:00pm*: Wrap up and prepare for tomorrow:
- Update risk dashboard with today's positions and limit status
- Prepare notes for tomorrow morning's risk report
- Respond to trader emails (questions on limits, position reports, trade approvals)
- Review tomorrow's calendar: 9am credit risk committee meeting, 2pm quarterly risk review with CRO

*6:00pm*: Head home. Typical hours for junior risk analysts are 6:30am-6pm. During month-end reporting or regulatory exams, may extend to 7pm. Weekend work rare unless major market event (e.g., bank failure, liquidity crisis) requiring emergency risk assessment.

*Evening*: Optional professional development - studying for FRM (Financial Risk Manager) exam or CFA Level II. Many risk professionals pursue FRM, CFA, or PRM (Professional Risk Manager) to advance careers.
