= Salesperson Roles in Sales and Trading

== Overview

Salespeople in Sales and Trading divisions are the primary client-facing professionals responsible for maintaining relationships with institutional investors, executing client trades, and generating revenue through commission and flow business. In Australia, sales roles exist at global investment banks (Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citi) and major Australian banks with institutional markets businesses (Macquarie Group, NAB, CBA, ANZ, Westpac).

Sales professionals bridge clients and trading desks - understanding client investment objectives, communicating market opportunities, executing trades, and providing market intelligence. Unlike traders who manage risk and make markets, or strategists who produce research, salespeople focus on relationships and revenue generation through client activity. The role combines relationship management, market knowledge, communication skills, and commercial acumen.

Post-GFC and post-Royal Commission, the sales role has evolved significantly with increased regulatory scrutiny around suitability and best execution, MiFID II research unbundling (affecting European clients), compression of trading margins driving need for higher volumes, and shift toward electronic execution requiring sales to add value through insights rather than just order-taking. Modern salespeople must be trusted advisors providing genuine value, not just order facilitators.

Review overnight flow from Asian markets - noticed Singapore sovereign wealth fund (GIC) was buying Australian bank bonds (NAB, ANZ senior debt) in size. This is useful color for your superannuation fund clients who also buy Australian credit.

Prepare morning client email summary:

*"Markets Update - [Date]"*

Good morning,

Key overnight developments:
- US equities mixed; tech weakness on higher yields (+5bp to 4.35%)
- AUD weaker 0.6510 (-25bp) on RBA Governor speech flagging potential cuts
- Oil steady at USD 82/bbl; gold +0.5% to USD 2,340/oz
- Asian flow: Strong buying in Australian bank senior debt (NAB 2029s, ANZ 2028s trading 10bp tighter)

Today's focus:
- Australian employment data (11:30am) - consensus +20k jobs, unemployment steady 3.6%
- RBA Assistant Governor speech (2:00pm) - watching for policy signals
- US retail sales (midnight tonight) - key for Fed outlook

Please reach out with any questions or if you'd like to discuss positioning ahead of employment data.

Send to your client list (you cover smaller accounts: regional super funds, smaller asset managers, some family offices). Senior salespeople handle the major accounts (AustralianSuper, HESTA, big fund managers).

*7:30am - 8:00am*: Morning sales meeting with entire sales desk, traders, research, and strategists. Head of sales opens: "Alright team, quiet overnight session. Key focus today is Australian employment data at 11:30. Rates strategist - what's the call?"

Rates strategist presents: "We expect in-line employment (+20k jobs), which keeps RBA in wait-and-see mode. If jobs strong (>30k), reduces near-term cut probability - would be negative for bonds (yields up), positive for AUD. If weak (\<10k), increases cut probability - bullish bonds, bearish AUD. We're positioned neutral into the number."

Fixed income trader: "I'm seeing good two-way flow ahead of data. Super funds generally adding duration (buying bonds) on weakness, overseas accounts looking to sell on any rally. Expect 5-10bp trading range around the number."

FX trader: "AUD 0.6510 this morning, down from 0.6535 on RBA speech. Stop losses clustered at 0.6500 - if we break that on weak data, could see quick move to 0.6480. Upside resistance 0.6550. Options market pricing 0.6% implied move on employment data."

Equity sales: "Corporate access today - Wesfarmers hosting lunch for institutional clients, 15 spots available. Let me know if your clients want to attend." You make note - one of your family office clients likes retail sector, might be interested.

Head of sales: "Sales priorities today: (1) Pre-position clients ahead of employment data - rates, FX, equity implications, (2) Push last week's structured note offering - we need AU\$50m more to close the book, (3) Follow up on quarterly portfolio reviews - we're behind on coverage." Meeting ends, team disperses.

*8:00am - 9:00am*: Series of client calls to discuss employment data positioning.

*Call 1 - Regional Superannuation Fund (AU\$5bn AUM):*

You: "Morning Sarah, just wanted to touch base ahead of employment data. How are you thinking about positioning?"

Client: "We're slightly underweight duration relative to benchmark - been cautious on bonds given RBA uncertainty. What's your view?"

You: "Our strategist thinks data comes in-line, but risk/reward favors adding duration here. Bond yields at 3.80% on 10-year are attractive entry point if RBA cuts over next 6 months as we expect. Employment is lagging indicator - even if strong today, likely weakens over Q1 as China slowdown flows through. Suggest using any weakness in bonds (yields higher) as buying opportunity."

Client: "Makes sense. If yields go to 3.90% on strong data, I'd look to add AU\$20m in 10-year bonds. Can you work that with your trader?"

You: "Absolutely. I'll alert fixed income desk - if we touch 3.90%, I'll give you a call and we can execute. Size is AU\$20m, correct?" 

Client confirms. You immediately message fixed income trader: "Client wants to buy AU\$20m 10yr bonds if yields hit 3.90% post-employment data. Please watch and let me know if we approach that level."

*Call 2 - Family Office (AU\$500m AUM):*

You: "Hi James, calling about employment data and also wanted to flag an opportunity. First, employment - expecting in-line print, but if you have views on AUD or equity market direction, happy to discuss hedging or positioning."

Client: "We're neutral for now, will react to data. What's the opportunity?"

You: "We're closing a structured note offering - 5-year ASX 200 linked, 100% capital protection, 80% participation in equity upside. Minimum AU\$500k investment. Given you mentioned wanting equity exposure with downside protection, this fits your mandate perfectly."

Client: "Interesting. What's the credit risk?"

You: "You're unsecured creditor to our bank [major bank name]. We're AA-rated. If that's within your counterparty limits, I can send full term sheet and we can discuss details. Book closes Friday - this is last call for allocation."

Client: "Send the term sheet, let me review and I'll revert by tomorrow."

You: "Perfect, sending now." Email term sheet with clear disclosure on structure, risks, and credit exposure.

*9:00am - 10:30am*: Quiet period before employment data. Use time for client portfolio reviews.

Pull portfolio analytics for one of your super fund clients - they've asked for quarterly performance review and positioning analysis. Using internal system, generate report showing:

*Client: XYZ Super Fund*
- Portfolio value: AU\$8bn
- Asset allocation: 25% Australian equities, 35% international equities, 25% fixed income, 10% alternatives, 5% cash
- Performance: +5.2% QTD vs benchmark +4.8% (outperformance +40bp)
- Attribution: Equity selection added value (+30bp), duration positioning added value (+20bp), FX hedging detracted (-10bp)

*Trading activity with our bank (Q3):*
- Fixed income: AU\$850m traded (bonds, swaps, futures)
- FX: AU\$1.2bn notional (spot, forwards, options)
- Equities: AU\$200m (cash equities, derivatives)
- Total commission revenue to bank: AU\$380k (down from AU\$420k prior quarter)

Flag to senior salesperson: "XYZ Super Fund trading volumes down 10% this quarter. May be giving more business to competitors. Should we schedule relationship review meeting?"

*10:30am - 11:00am*: Senior salesperson asks you to join client presentation call for major asset manager exploring currency hedging program.

Client background: Australian equity fund manager (AU\$15bn AUM) with 30% international equity exposure (USD, EUR, GBP). Currently unhedged, considering implementing passive hedge program (hedge 50% of FX exposure).

FX strategist presents: "Current environment favors partial hedging for Australian investors. AUD at 0.6510 is relatively weak - hedging now locks in favorable conversion rate if AUD strengthens. We recommend 50% passive hedge (systematic, not tactical) to reduce portfolio volatility from FX swings while maintaining some upside if AUD weakens further."

FX trader presents execution strategy: "For AU\$4.5bn equivalent FX exposure, we'd implement via rolling 3-month forward contracts. Execution in tranches over 2 weeks to minimize market impact. All-in cost approximately 15bp (includes forward points, bid-offer spread, our fee). We'd provide monthly hedging reports and rebalancing recommendations."

Client asks: "What if AUD weakens significantly after we hedge - do we regret locking in?"

FX strategist: "Possible, but remember: hedging is insurance, not speculation. Goal is reducing volatility, not trying to time FX. Historically, 50% hedge ratio provides optimal risk-adjusted returns for Australian investors with global equities - reduces drawdowns without fully eliminating FX contribution."

Senior salesperson: "We can structure flexibly - start with 25% hedge, scale to 50% over time. Or use options (buy AUD put protection) instead of forwards for more flexibility, though costs more. Happy to model different approaches."

Meeting ends well - client will discuss internally and revert next week. Senior salesperson to you after call: "Good job sitting in and listening. Next time, I'll have you present the execution strategy section - start getting comfortable with client presentations."

*11:00am - 11:30am*: Final preparation before employment data. Check with traders on client interest:

Fixed income trader: "I have three clients wanting to buy bonds if yields hit 3.90%, two clients wanting to sell if yields fall to 3.70%. Balanced flow."

FX trader: "Seeing more downside interest in AUD - four clients want to sell AUD (go short) if we break 0.6500, only one client looking to buy. Positioning bearish."

Equity trader: "Quiet - most equity clients waiting for data before committing."

*11:30am - 12:00pm*: Employment data released: *Jobs +35k (strong beat vs +20k expected), unemployment steady at 3.6%.*

Immediate market reaction:
- AUD spikes to 0.6560 (+50bp / +0.8%)
- Bond yields jump to 3.88% (+8bp)
- Equity futures up +0.4%

Your phone explodes with client calls and messages:

*Client 1 (regional super fund):* "Data strong - yields at 3.88%, close to my 3.90% buy level. What's your trader's view?"

You quickly call fixed income trader: "Client wants to buy AU\$20m 10yr at 3.90%. Data strong, do you think we get there?"

Trader: "Maybe - seeing profit-taking after initial move. Could touch 3.90% in next 30 minutes if selling continues. Tell client I'll watch and call you if we approach."

Relay to client: "Trader watching closely, will call you if we approach 3.90%. Stand by."

*Client 2 (family office):* "We want to sell AUD - data strong but we think temporary. Can you execute AUD/USD sell for us, USD 5m notional?"

You: "Absolutely. Current market 0.6555-0.6560. We can offer you 0.6557 on USD 5m sell (you sell AUD, buy USD). Does that work?"

Client: "Done." You execute via FX trader, confirm with client immediately. Trade ticket sent.

*Client 3 (hedge fund):* "Strong employment reduces RBA cut probability. We want to sell Australian bonds (bet on yields higher). Can you offer on AU\$50m 10yr futures?"

You coordinate with fixed income trader, execute sale. Commission earned: AU\$12.5k (25bp on AU\$50m).

Frantic 30 minutes. You coordinate 5 client trades across fixed income, FX, and equities. Total commission revenue: AU\$45k. Senior salesperson high-fives you: "Great flow! Keep hustling."

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Post-data client follow-up. Write quick email to client list:

*"Employment Data Reaction & Positioning Update"*

Strong employment data (+35k vs +20k expected) drove AUD +0.8% to 0.6560 and bond yields +8bp to 3.88%. Key takeaways:

1. *RBA implications*: Near-term cut pressure reduced, but medium-term easing still likely as employment is lagging indicator
2. *AUD*: Broke above 0.6550 resistance, next target 0.6580-0.6600 if strength continues
3. *Bonds*: Yields up but holding below 3.90% - suggests market still expects eventual RBA cuts
4. *Equities*: Modest positive reaction (+0.4%) on strong economy confirmation

*Our view* (per strategist): Data doesn't change medium-term bearish AUD outlook (target 0.6400) or bullish bond view (target 3.40% yields). Use AUD strength as opportunity to establish short positions, use bond weakness as buying opportunity.

Happy to discuss specific positioning ideas - please call.

Also, field several client queries about what strong employment means for portfolio positioning. You provide strategist's view but remind clients: "This is our view - ultimately you need to make decision based on your own analysis and mandate. We're here to facilitate execution and provide market intelligence."

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Lunch meeting with client (small boutique fund manager, AU\$1bn AUM). Relationship-building lunch - no specific agenda, just staying connected.

Conversation covers:
- Client's portfolio positioning (they're overweight Australian equities, underweight international)
- Market outlook discussion (you share strategist views, client shares their perspective)
- Feedback on your service: "You've been great - responsive, good market color. One thing: we'd like more access to your equity research analysts for company-specific calls. Can you arrange?"
- You commit: "Absolutely - I'll coordinate with equity research team. Any specific companies you want to discuss?"
- Personal relationship building: Discuss weekend plans, common interests (both follow AFL - you're Carlton supporter, client supports Collingwood, friendly banter)

Build rapport beyond just business transactions. Strong relationships drive loyalty and flow.

*2:00pm - 3:00pm*: Work on pitch for new prospect - insurance company (QBE) looking for credit derivative solutions.

Client: Wesfarmers (BBB+ rated, AU\$50bn market cap, diversified retail/industrials). Background: Treasurer wants to issue AU\$500m 10-year bond, concerned about inflation risk (CPI currently 3.5%, above RBA target). Considering inflation-linked bond (ILB) vs structured alternative.

Prepare preliminary pitch deck:

*"Credit Risk Management Solutions for Insurance Companies"*

Slide 1: Client Challenge
- Large corporate bond portfolio (AU\$5bn)
- Credit risk concentration in financials and resources
- Desire to reduce risk without selling (tax implications, market impact)
- Maintain portfolio yield and income

Slide 2: Solution - Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
- Buy CDS protection on specific bonds (e.g., CBA senior debt)
- If issuer defaults, CDS pays out, offsetting bond loss
- Retain bond on balance sheet (no sale needed)
- Cost: Annual CDS premium (typically 0.5-2% of notional depending on credit quality)

Slide 3: Alternative - Credit Index Hedges
- Buy protection on Australian corporate credit index (iTraxx Australia)
- Hedges overall credit spread widening risk
- Cheaper than single-name CDS (diversification benefit)
- Cost: ~0.8% pa for investment-grade index

Send draft to senior salesperson for review before approaching client.

*3:00pm - 4:00pm*: Administrative tasks and CRM updates.

Update Salesforce CRM with today's activities:
- Client 1 (regional super fund): Executed AU\$20m bond purchase, revenue AU\$5k
- Client 2 (family office): Executed USD 5m FX trade, revenue AU\$2k
- Client 3 (hedge fund): Executed AU\$50m bond futures, revenue AU\$12.5k
- Lunch meeting with boutique fund manager: No transaction, relationship building
- Prospect pitch (QBE insurance): In progress, presenting next week

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Weekly pipeline review meeting with senior salesperson. He reviews your client list and asks for updates:

Senior: "Talk me through your top opportunities this quarter."

You present:
1. *Regional super fund (AU\$5bn)*: Historically AU\$100m quarterly flow, down to AU\$70m this quarter. Opportunity: Schedule quarterly review meeting, understand if service issues or if moving flow to competitors. Target: Restore to AU\$100m+ quarterly.

2. *Family office (AU\$500m)*: Interested in structured products, just sent term sheet for protected note. Opportunity: Close AU\$1-2m investment this quarter, build relationship for future flow. Target: Become primary derivatives provider.

3. *Boutique fund manager (AU\$1bn)*: Strong relationship, consistent flow (AU\$5m per quarter in commissions). Opportunity: Expand product coverage - they only use us for FX and fixed income, want to introduce equity derivatives and research access. Target: 20% revenue increase.

*5:00pm - 6:00pm*: Market close and end-of-day wrap. AUD finishing at 0.6555 (up 0.7% on day), bond yields 3.86% (up 6bp), equities flat.

*Evening*: Leave office around 6:30pm on normal day. During volatile markets or major client deadlines, can extend to 7:30-8:00pm. Sales roles generally have better hours than trading (which often requires 6am starts and can extend to 7-8pm regularly).

=== MiFID II Impact on Sales

*Background:*
MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II), effective January 2018 in Europe, unbundled research from execution. While Australian banks aren't directly regulated by MiFID II, many have global clients subject to it.

*Key Changes:*
- *Research Unbundling*: European asset managers must pay for research separately from execution (can't bundle)
- *Best Execution*: Enhanced requirements to demonstrate best execution achieved
- *Inducements*: Restrictions on gifts, entertainment, and benefits to clients
- *Transparency*: Enhanced reporting on execution quality and costs

*Adaptation Strategies:*
- *Value-Added Services*: Focus on unique insights (market color, flow intelligence, access to traders)
- *Execution Quality*: Invest in algos, smart order routing, best execution frameworks
- *Customization*: Tailor research and ideas to specific client needs (not generic research)
- *Technology*: Provide data, analytics, and tools beyond basic execution
- *Relationship Depth*: Deepen advisory relationships (portfolio construction, risk management consulting)

=== Technology Disrupting Traditional Sales

*Electronic Execution Platforms:*
- Bloomberg SWAP, TSOX, Tradeweb (fixed income, derivatives)
- FXall, 360T (FX trading)
- Algorithmic execution in equities
- *Impact*: Reduces need for voice broking on vanilla trades
- *Sales Response*: Focus on complex trades, advice, and relationship

*Data & Analytics:*
- TCA (Transaction Cost Analysis) platforms
- Execution quality dashboards
- Flow analytics and positioning data
- *Impact*: Clients can objectively measure execution quality
- *Sales Response*: Proactively share TCA, demonstrate execution quality

*Direct Market Access:*
- Clients can trade directly on exchanges/platforms
- Reduces intermediation by salespeople
- *Impact*: Disintermediation threat for simple trades
- *Sales Response*: Add value through insights, complex execution, risk management

== Conclusion

Sales roles in Sales & Trading offer dynamic careers combining relationship management, market expertise, and commercial acumen. Success requires deep product knowledge, exceptional communication skills, resilience, and genuine commitment to client success. The Australian institutional market, while smaller than US/Europe, provides excellent opportunities given:

*Large Domestic Client Base*: Australia's AU\$4+ trillion superannuation system creates sophisticated institutional client base with significant trading needs across all asset classes.

*Relationship-Driven Market*: Australian institutional market values long-term relationships and trusted advice, rewarding salespeople who invest in deep client partnerships.

*Product Sophistication*: Clients use full range of products (equities, fixed income, FX, derivatives, alternatives), creating opportunities for cross-selling and complex solutions.

*Global Connectivity*: Australian institutions invest globally, requiring FX hedging, international execution, and cross-border capabilities.

*Regulatory Evolution*: Post-Royal Commission focus on client outcomes aligns with professional, advice-driven sales approach.

Key attributes for successful salespeople include:

*Technical Excellence*: Deep knowledge across products, markets, and investment processes - clients expect salespeople to be experts who add value beyond order-taking.

*Relationship Skills*: Building trust, understanding client needs (stated and unstated), reliability, integrity, and long-term commitment.

*Commercial Acumen*: Understanding what drives revenue (for clients and your bank), identifying opportunities, negotiating win-win outcomes.

*Communication*: Explaining complex ideas simply, storytelling (selling ideas compellingly), active listening, and tailoring messages to audience.

*Resilience*: Handling rejection (many pitches don't succeed), recovering from mistakes, maintaining energy through market cycles.

*Collaboration*: Working across internal teams (traders, research, structuring), sharing credit, supporting colleagues.

*Integrity*: Always acting in client's best interest, transparency, admitting when you don't know something, ethical conduct.

The career path typically progresses: Junior Salesperson → Salesperson → Senior Salesperson → Head of Sales, with opportunities to specialize (equity sales, FX sales, institutional coverage) or lead teams. The role has evolved post-GFC and post-Royal Commission from transactional order-taking toward advisory relationship management, with technology handling vanilla execution while salespeople focus on complex solutions and strategic advice.

For students considering sales careers in institutional markets, building strong foundations in finance (understanding products and markets), developing communication skills (presenting, writing, listening), and gaining client-facing experience (internships, client service roles) are essential. Complement technical knowledge with emotional intelligence and relationship skills - the best salespeople combine analytical rigor with genuine empathy and interest in helping clients succeed.

The Australian sales landscape offers unique opportunities: serving the world's fourth-largest pension system, facilitating commodity hedging for major resources companies, and bridging Asian and global markets. For those passionate about markets, relationships, and helping institutional investors achieve their goals, sales roles provide a fulfilling career at the center of capital markets activity.

Success in institutional sales ultimately comes from being a trusted advisor who clients rely on for objective advice, superior execution, and genuine partnership - not just someone taking orders. The best salespeople are those clients call first in volatile markets, trust with their largest trades, and partner with on strategic decisions. Building that level of trust requires years of consistent delivery, integrity, and putting client interests first - but the rewards, both financial and professional, are substantial for those who excel.
