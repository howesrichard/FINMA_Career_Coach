= Strategist (Sales & Trading) - Career Pathways

This document outlines career progression for strategist roles in Sales & Trading divisions at investment banks and financial institutions, with a focus on the Australian market. Strategists combine macroeconomic analysis with market insights to provide clients with actionable investment recommendations across asset classes.

#pagebreak()

== Overview: What Does a Strategist Do?

Strategists in Sales & Trading divisions are macro researchers and market analysts who help institutional clients (hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds) make investment decisions. Unlike economists who focus primarily on economic forecasting, or equity analysts who cover specific stocks, strategists take a top-down view on markets and translate macro analysis into specific asset allocation and positioning recommendations.

*Key Differences From Related Roles:*

- *Economist*: Focuses on economic forecasting (GDP, inflation, employment) and explaining economic developments. Strategists incorporate economic views but extend to market implications and specific trade recommendations.
- *Equity Analyst*: Bottom-up company and sector analysis. Strategists provide top-down macro views that inform sector allocation and equity market positioning.
- *Portfolio Manager*: Makes actual investment decisions with real capital. Strategists advise clients on positioning but don't manage portfolios themselves (unless transitioning to buy-side PM role).
- *Trader*: Executes and takes risk on positions. Strategists develop views and research, traders implement and manage positions.

*Core Responsibilities of Strategists:*

1. *Macro Analysis*: Monitoring and analyzing economic data, central bank policies, geopolitical developments, and their market implications
2. *Market Strategy*: Developing directional views on asset classes (equities, bonds, currencies, commodities) with specific entry/exit levels
3. *Client Advisory*: Communicating views to institutional clients through written research, presentations, calls, and meetings
4. *Thought Leadership*: Publishing research that shapes market narratives and influences investment decisions
5. *Cross-Asset Insights*: Understanding relationships between asset classes and identifying relative value opportunities
6. *Risk Scenarios*: Developing bull/base/bear cases and stress-testing portfolios against macro shocks
7. *Trading Support*: Working with sales and trading desks to facilitate client flows and positioning

*Primary Asset Classes Covered (Often Specialized):*

- *Interest Rates / Fixed Income Strategy*: Government bonds, inflation-linked bonds, credit spreads
- *Foreign Exchange (FX) Strategy*: Currency pairs, carry trades, FX volatility
- *Equity Strategy*: Index levels, sector allocation, style factors (value vs growth)
- *Commodities Strategy*: Oil, metals, agricultural commodities
- *Cross-Asset Strategy*: Multi-asset views and portfolio construction (senior/generalist role)

*Typical Clients:*

- Hedge funds (macro, multi-strategy, equity long/short)
- Asset managers (mutual funds, ETFs)
- Pension funds and superannuation funds
- Insurance companies
- Sovereign wealth funds
- Corporate treasuries (for hedging and investment needs)
- Private banks and family offices

=== Day in the Life: Junior Strategist, Australian Bank

*7:00am - 7:30am*: Arrive at desk (early start common in Australian markets to cover offshore developments). Check overnight developments: US equity close, key data releases, central bank speeches, major corporate news. Review Bloomberg terminal and competitor research.

*7:30am - 8:00am*: Morning call preparation. Update key market levels (AUD/USD, S&P500, Aussie 10-year bond yield, iron ore, oil). Summarize overnight themes. Draft one-page summary for senior strategist to review.

*8:00am - 8:15am*: Join morning strategy call with sales, trading, and strategy teams. Senior strategist presents market overview using your summary and adds commentary. Traders discuss flows and positioning. Sales raise client questions. You take notes on action items.

Example discussion: "AUD sold off overnight to 0.6480 from 0.6520 close. Weaker-than-expected China PMI data drove move. Question from sales: Are we revising our AUD forecast? Senior strategist responds: Consistent with our bearish view, but not changing target yet. Junior strategist, can you update our AUD model with latest data and circulate by lunch?"

*8:15am - 9:30am*: Execute action items from morning call. Update AUD fair value model in Excel:
- Input latest interest rate differentials (RBA vs Fed)
- Update commodity price indices (iron ore, coal, LNG prices)
- Refresh risk sentiment indicators (VIX, credit spreads)
- Calculate implied "fair value" for AUD/USD

Model output: AUD/USD fair value 0.6420 vs current spot 0.6480 = 60 pips overvalued. Consistent with senior strategist's bearish call. Document assumptions and circulate findings to strategy team with updated chart showing historical model accuracy.

*9:30am - 10:30am*: Work on weekly research publication. This week's focus: "RBA Policy Outlook - Approaching End of Tightening Cycle?" Senior strategist outlined the structure; you're drafting the data and historical analysis sections.

Tasks:
- Pull RBA cash rate history, compare current cycle to previous tightening cycles
- Analyze inflation breakdown (goods vs services, tradable vs non-tradable)
- Create charts showing inflation trajectory vs RBA's forecasts
- Calculate implied market pricing from overnight indexed swaps (OIS) - market pricing 25bp of cuts over next 12 months vs RBA guidance of neutral stance
- Draft section: "Market pricing appears overly dovish given RBA's recent guidance and still-elevated services inflation..."

*10:30am - 11:00am*: Coffee with senior strategist (valuable learning opportunity). Discuss approach to RBA analysis: "When you're forecasting central bank policy, focus on three things: inflation trajectory, labor market slack, and central bank communication. Data is important, but understanding how central bankers are thinking is critical. Read every RBA speech, minutes, and statement carefully. They signal changes before they happen."

Senior strategist also gives feedback on your draft: "Good analysis on inflation, but you need to make clearer market implications. Client reading this should know: should I be long or short Aussie bonds? What's the trade? Always connect macro analysis to actionable positioning."

*11:00am - 12:00pm*: Ad-hoc request from trading desk. Rates trader asks: "Can you quickly pull together chart showing Australian 10-year bond yield vs US 10-year going back 5 years? Client asking about correlation." 

You build chart in Bloomberg, add annotations for key events (COVID, RBA policy shifts, Fed hiking cycle), calculate rolling correlation (currently 0.75, elevated vs historical average 0.60), and send to trader within 15 minutes. Trader responds: "Perfect, exactly what I needed. Client buying 10-year Aussie bonds on our strategist's bullish call."

This type of reactive support is common for junior strategists - being responsive to sales/trading requests builds internal relationships and demonstrates value.

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch at desk (typical). Use time to catch up on reading: Australian Financial Review (AFR), RBA bulletin published today, competitor research from UBS and JPMorgan on AUD outlook. Take notes on key points and different perspectives vs your team's view.

*1:00pm - 2:00pm*: Prepare materials for client presentation next week. Senior strategist is meeting with large superannuation fund (major client) and needs updated deck on Australian equities outlook.

Your tasks:
- Update macro slides (growth, inflation, RBA policy forecast)
- Refresh equity market valuation metrics (P/E ratios, earnings yield vs bond yields)
- Create sector performance attribution chart (which sectors drove ASX 200 returns YTD)
- Update international comparison (Australian equities vs US, Europe, Asia on valuation and performance)
- Ensure all data current as of yesterday's close, charts properly formatted, sources cited

*2:00pm - 3:00pm*: Weekly educational session organized by head of strategy. This week: "Understanding Central Bank Forward Guidance" presented by chief economist. Topics covered:
- Evolution of central bank communication (historical opacity vs modern transparency)
- Types of forward guidance (Odyssean vs Delphic, time-based vs state-contingent)
- How to interpret FOMC dot plots, RBA's qualitative guidance, ECB's language
- Case studies: ECB's "lower for longer", RBA's 2021 forward guidance on cash rate

Junior strategists expected to attend these sessions. Great for building macro knowledge and understanding how to interpret central bank signals.

*3:00pm - 4:00pm*: Australian GDP data released at 11:30am gets market attention (disappointed expectations, Q3 GDP +0.3% q/q vs 0.5% expected). AUD weakens further to 0.6460. Senior strategist asks you to draft "quick take" analysis for clients.

You write:
"Australia Q3 GDP miss (0.3% vs 0.5% expected) driven by weak household consumption and declining business investment. Reinforces our below-consensus growth forecast for next year (1.5% vs RBA's 2.0%). Bolsters case for RBA rate cuts in H2 next year. Market reaction: AUD -20 pips, Aussie 3-year bond yields -5bps. We remain bearish AUD (targeting 0.6400) and bullish Australian duration."

Senior strategist reviews, makes edits to tighten language, and publishes to clients within 45 minutes of data release. You learn from edits: be more concise, lead with market implications, emphasize consistency with team's existing calls.

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Update tracking spreadsheets and databases:
- Log today's key data releases and market moves
- Update team's "calls tracker" with current P&L on all published recommendations
- Refresh commodity prices database (iron ore, met coal, thermal coal, LNG) for tomorrow's commodities strategy update
- Maintain "central bank communications log" with links to every RBA speech, minutes, testimony

These administrative tasks are essential - clean data and organized tracking enable efficient research process.

*5:00pm - 5:30pm*: Prepare for tomorrow. Check calendar: 8am morning call as usual, 10am meeting with senior strategist to review draft RBA research piece, 2pm client call (you're listening in but not presenting). 

Check tomorrow's scheduled events: US non-farm payrolls (key data point for Fed policy and global markets), RBA Governor speech at economics conference, China Caixin PMI. Plan to arrive by 7am to review overnight US employment data before morning call.

*5:30pm - 6:00pm*: Remaining time used for reading/learning. Today: Read BIS (Bank for International Settlements) paper on "Inflation Persistence and Monetary Policy" to deepen understanding of current inflation dynamics. Senior strategist mentioned it this morning, said it's relevant to RBA analysis you're working on.

*Evening*: Leave office around 6:00pm. Check phone later for any major overnight events (unlikely given US payrolls not until tomorrow). Junior strategists typically don't need to be constantly available outside work hours unless major market stress.

=== Day in the Life: Strategist (FX & Rates), Global Bank (Sydney)

*6:45am - 7:30am*: Early start to review overnight developments. US markets closed: S&P 500 -0.8% on hawkish Fed comments, 10-year Treasury yields +12bp to 4.35%, USD stronger across the board (DXY index +0.6%). Most relevant for your coverage: AUD/USD down from 0.6550 to 0.6520 overnight.

Review Fed speaker (Governor Waller) comments: emphasized need to keep rates higher for longer given persistent services inflation. Market repricing: now expecting only 50bp of Fed cuts next year vs 75bp yesterday.

Check Bloomberg, Reuters, read overnight research from US strategists, review competitor analysis. Start drafting morning call talking points.

*7:30am - 8:00am*: Finalize your section for morning call. Your key messages:

1. *Fed Hawkish Repricing*: Waller comments extended recent hawkish shift. Market now closer to our below-consensus Fed view (we've forecast 50bp cuts for Q2-Q3 next year vs consensus 75bp).

2. *AUD Implications*: Fed hawkishness is USD positive, AUD negative. Reinforces our bearish AUD call. Current 0.6520 closer to our 0.6400 target.

3. *Aussie Bonds*: Interesting divergence - RBA likely to cut more than Fed given weaker Australian growth. Bullish Aussie duration (10-year bonds targeting 3.25% from current 3.77%).

4. *Today's Focus*: Australian employment data (11:30am AEDT). Consensus expects 15k jobs added, unemployment steady 3.7%. Watching for wage growth signals.

*8:00am - 8:30am*: Morning strategy call with sales, trading, research teams (50+ people on call). 

Chief strategist leads: "Overnight themes - Fed hawkish repricing, USD strength, equities weaker. Let's go around asset classes. FX and rates?"

You present: "AUD under pressure overnight, now 0.6520. We remain bearish, targeting 0.6400. Key drivers: Fed hawkish relative to RBA, China growth concerns, weakening commodities. Stop loss 0.6650. On rates, we like Australian bonds here - see value at 3.75-3.80% on the 10-year, targeting 3.25% on 75bp of RBA cuts through next year. Today's employment data could be catalyst."

Sales questions: "Client asking - if employment strong today, does that change your RBA call?" You respond: "One data point won't change our view. We're focused on broader trend: consumption weakening, housing slowing, China headwinds. Even if employment solid today, we expect labor market to weaken through next year, forcing RBA to cut. But if we get several strong employment reports, we'd reassess."

Call continues: equity strategist discusses sector views, commodities strategist on oil outlook, credit strategist on spread levels. You take notes on key themes for your own research.

*8:30am - 10:30am*: Deep work on research publication. This week you're publishing: "Australian Dollar: The Case for 0.6400." Major piece - will go to all institutional clients and likely get media pickup.

Structure:
- Executive Summary: Bearish AUD to 0.6400 (current 0.6520) over 3-6 months
- Key drivers: (1) RBA-Fed policy divergence, (2) China growth slowdown, (3) Weakening Australian terms of trade
- Trade recommendation: Sell AUD/USD at 0.6520, target 0.6400, stop loss 0.6650
- Alternative exposures: Sell AUD/JPY (if prefer higher carry), buy AUD puts

You write:

"Australia's economic divergence from the United States is becoming increasingly apparent. While the Fed maintains higher-for-longer guidance with inflation proving persistent, the RBA faces slowing growth, weakening consumption, and a deteriorating housing market. We forecast 75bp of RBA cuts beginning Q2 2025, compared to 50bp from the Fed - a dovish divergence that should pressure AUD.

China's sluggish recovery poses additional headwinds. PMI data continues disappointing, property sector remains weak, and fiscal stimulus underwhelms. Australian commodity exports suffer: iron ore prices down 15% year-to-date, coal prices retreating. Terms of trade declining.

Technical picture supports downside: AUD/USD broke key support at 0.6550, opening path to 0.6400. MACD bearish, RSI 38 (approaching oversold but not extreme). Positioning per CFTC data shows modest net shorts - room for capitulation move lower.

Risk scenario: This call is wrong if China announces large fiscal stimulus package or Fed turns decisively dovish. Monitor China policy closely. Our stop loss 0.6650 (recent high)."

Include charts: AUD/USD historical with forecast, rates differentials, commodity prices, positioning data, technical analysis.

*10:30am - 11:15am*: Sales trader calls: "Hedge fund client wants to talk about your bearish AUD view. Can you jump on call now?" You agree (flexibility required in strategist role).

Client (hedge fund PM): "We read your AUD analysis. Generally agree, but timing concerns. China could announce stimulus any day - that would blow up the short AUD trade. How do you think about timing?"

You respond: "Fair concern. We've been watching China policy closely. Our view: authorities talking about stimulus but delivery remains limited. They're reluctant to do massive stimulus like 2008-09 or 2015-16. More likely: incremental measures that disappoint. If I'm wrong and they do big fiscal package, yes, AUD rallies sharply and our call is wrong - that's why we have stop loss at 0.6650.

On timing: We think 3-6 month window. Near-term catalyst could be tomorrow's Australian employment data - if weak, reinforces RBA dovish pivot. Or next week's China PMI. Rather than waiting for perfect entry, we'd suggest building position in tranches: sell some now, add on any rallies toward 0.6550-0.6600."

Client: "Makes sense. Also, what about downside risks below 0.6400? If we get there, how much further could it go?"

You: "0.6400 is our base case, but bear scenario has 0.6200-0.6250 as next support. That's where China hard-landing fully priced. Would require significant deterioration beyond current expectations. Not our central case but possible tail risk."

Client thanks you, says he'll discuss with team. After call, you email summary of conversation to sales trader for their records.

*11:15am - 11:30am*: Quick prep before Australian employment data release. Check Bloomberg consensus, review your forecast, prepare potential reactions:
- If jobs beat and unemployment falls: "AUD positive near-term, but doesn't change medium-term bearish view" 
- If jobs disappoint: "Validates RBA dovish pivot thesis, adds conviction to AUD short"
- If mixed (e.g., jobs OK but unemployment rises): "Labor market loosening, supports our view"

*11:30am - 12:00pm*: Australian employment data releases: 5k jobs (vs 15k expected), unemployment rises to 3.9% (vs 3.7% expected). Market reaction: AUD drops immediately to 0.6480 (-40 pips), Aussie 3-year bond yields fall 8bp.

You quickly publish "flash comment" to clients: "Australian employment misses across the board - validates our view that labor market is softening. Unemployment rising signals emerging slack, strengthening case for RBA cuts. AUD weakness justified. We remain bearish, targeting 0.6400."

Send to sales team, post on research portal, tweet summary (if firm policy allows): "Australian employment disappoints: +5k jobs vs +15k expected, unemployment 3.9% vs 3.7%. Labor market loosening supports RBA dovish pivot. Bearish AUD."

*12:00pm - 1:00pm*: Lunch meeting with equity strategist (colleague in your firm). Discussing cross-asset views: "Your bearish AUD call - what does that mean for Australian equities? Do you think weak AUD helps exporters?"

You: "Complex. Weak AUD theoretically helps exporters, but our AUD weakness driven by China slowdown and weak commodities. So resources stocks (major exporters) suffering from commodity price declines more than benefiting from FX. Net negative for ASX. I'd be underweight resources, prefer domestics or healthcare."

Equity strategist: "Interesting, aligns with my sector allocation. Let's co-author piece: 'Weak AUD: Not All Good News for Australian Equities.'"

You agree. Cross-asset collaboration like this produces valuable differentiated research.

*1:00pm - 3:30pm*: Client roadshow preparation. Next week you're traveling to Melbourne with sales team for client meetings (superannuation funds, asset managers). Need presentation deck covering your macro views and positioning recommendations.

Build presentation:

Slide 1: Executive Summary
- Macro view: Global growth slowing, central banks near peak rates, China struggling
- AUD: Bearish to 0.6400
- Aussie Bonds: Bullish, target 3.25% on 10-year
- Equities: Neutral, prefer quality over cyclicals

Slide 2: Australian Economic Outlook
- GDP forecast: +1.5% next year (below consensus 2.0%, below RBA 2.0%)
- Inflation: Moderating to 2.5% by mid-year (within RBA target band)
- Employment: Loosening, unemployment rising to 4.5%
- Housing: Prices stagnating, construction weak

Slide 3: RBA Policy Outlook
- First cut Q2 2025 (May meeting)
- Total cuts: 75bp to 3.60% by end-2025
- Market pricing: 25bp currently priced (too dovish)
- Key catalyst: Slowing growth and labor market slack

Slide 4: AUD Strategy
- Target 0.6400 (current 0.6520)
- Three bearish drivers: RBA dovish vs Fed, China weakness, commodities
- Fair value model: AUD overvalued by 3-5% based on rates, commodities, risk sentiment
- Technical analysis: Breakdown below 0.6550 opens path to 0.6400
- Positioning: Speculative shorts building but not extreme - room to run

Slide 5: Rates Strategy
- Australian 10yr bonds attractive at 3.75-3.85% (current 3.77%)
- Target 3.25% on 75bp RBA cuts + global duration demand
- Risk/reward: 50bp upside, 25bp downside (stop loss 4.00%)

Slide 6: Portfolio Implications
- Underweight AUD in FX portfolios
- Overweight duration in Australian fixed income
- Neutral equities with quality bias (defensives over cyclicals)
- Underweight resources, overweight healthcare/infrastructure

Create supporting appendix with detailed data, model methodology, historical analysis. Send to senior strategist for review before tomorrow's presentations.

*4:00pm - 5:00pm*: Weekly strategy team meeting with Head of Strategy and all strategists (rates, FX, commodities, equities, credit). Each strategist presents key calls and debates upcoming research priorities.

You present AUD/bond call update: "Maintaining bearish AUD (target 0.6400) and bullish Aus bonds (target 3.25%). Fed hawkish minutes overnight validated our divergence thesis. Recommend keeping these as flagship calls for Q4."

Commodities strategist pushes back: "I think you're too bearish on AUD. If China stabilizes even modestly, AUD could rally hard. Your 0.6400 target seems aggressive."

You defend: "Fair point, but what's your evidence China is stabilizing? PMI below 50 for three months, property still declining, credit growth weak. I'd change my view if we see credible fiscal stimulus, but talking about stimulus without delivery doesn't cut it."

Head of Strategy weighs in: "Both views valid. I like the bearish AUD call but let's be transparent about risks in our research. Make sure you're clear with clients: if China delivers big stimulus, this call is wrong and we'll exit."

Discussion moves to other topics:
- US election implications for markets (November getting close)
- ECB policy path (more dovish than Fed but still cautious)
- Oil outlook (geopolitical risks vs demand concerns)
- Australian earnings season takeaways

Meeting ends with action items: You're assigned to write piece on "US Election Scenarios for Australian Assets" for publication in 2 weeks. Need to analyze Trump vs Harris implications for AUD, bonds, equities.

*5:00pm - 6:00pm*: Respond to accumulated client emails and sales requests:

1. Sales: "Client asking - if AUD breaks 0.6400, what's next target?" You: "0.6200-0.6250 range. That's where China hard-landing scenario prices in. Would be major move requiring significant deterioration."

2. Client (hedge fund): "Do you have quantitative model for AUD fair value? Can you share?" You: "Yes, we use multi-factor model: rates differential (30% weight), commodity prices (25%), risk sentiment (20%), terms of trade (15%), current account (10%). Currently model shows 0.6420 fair value vs 0.6480 spot = 60bp overvalued. Will send detailed methodology separately."

3. Sales: "Client questioning your bullish bond call - argues RBA might not cut if employment stays strong." You: "Employment is lagging indicator - typically weakens 3-6 months after growth slows. China weakness + housing slowdown will eventually hit jobs. Even if RBA only cuts 50bp (vs our 75bp base case), bonds still have 25-30bp upside from here. Risk/reward favors long."

4. Journalist (Reuters): "Can I get quote on today's China trade data?" You provide: "Import weakness in today's China trade data underscores domestic demand challenges, which has negative implications for Australian commodity exports and supports our bearish view on the Australian dollar."

5. Internal (trader): "Your AUD call going well, any thoughts on tactics for client execution?" You: "For clients building short AUD positions, suggest using options to define risk (buy AUD puts struck 0.6400-0.6450, 3-6 month expiry). Cheaper than stop-losses and limits downside if wrong."

*6:00pm - 6:30pm*: End-of-day summary and planning. Update personal tracking spreadsheet of all your published calls with current P&L:

- Short AUD/USD (entry 0.6550, current 0.6480, target 0.6400): +70bp unrealized, on track
- Long Aus 10yr bonds (entry 3.85%, current 3.77%, target 3.25%): +8bp unrealized, on track  
- Underweight Australian resources (called 3 months ago): -2% underperformance, correct call
- Neutral equities (called 6 months ago): ASX 200 flat, neutral call correct

Overall: 75% of calls profitable or on track. Need to monitor AUD call closely - getting close to target, will need to decide whether to take profit or extend lower.

Prepare for tomorrow:
- 8:00am: Morning call as usual
- 10:00am: Depart for Melbourne roadshow
- 11:30am: First client meeting (AustralianSuper)
- 1:30pm: Second meeting (fund manager)
- 3:30pm: Third meeting (super fund)
- Evening: Return to Sydney

Pack materials for roadshow: presentation deck, backup charts, data on iPad, business cards. Review talking points for each client (different focus based on their mandates and interests).

*Evening*: Leave office around 6:30pm. Check markets from home before bed. AUD consolidating around 0.6480, US futures quiet. No major overnight events scheduled, should be quiet Asian session. Take-home reading: Preparing for US election research piece - read latest polling data, policy proposals from both candidates, historical analysis of election impacts on markets.

- Portfolio optimization (Sharpe ratios, efficient frontiers)

=== Relationship with Trading Desks

*How Strategists Support Traders:*
- *Macro Views*: Providing top-down perspective to inform trader positioning
- *Catalysts*: Identifying upcoming events and market-moving data
- *Themes*: Highlighting cross-asset opportunities (e.g., "divergence trade")
- *Risk Scenarios*: Stress-testing portfolios against macro shocks
- *Client Flow*: Explaining client positioning and flow trends
- *Market Color*: Interpreting market moves and news developments

*How Traders Use Strategy Research:*

- Hedging decisions (e.g., buying downside protection based on risk scenarios)
- Client conversations (sharing strategy views to generate flow)
- Risk management (adjusting exposures based on macro outlook)
- Idea generation (identifying relative value opportunities from strategist analysis)

*Tension Points:*
- Strategists have medium-term view (3-6 months), traders often shorter-term (days-weeks)
- Strategists make calls in research, traders must execute and manage risk
- When strategy calls wrong, traders may lose money - can create friction
- Traders focused on P&L, strategists on research quality and client relationships

*Best Practices for Collaboration:*
- Regular communication (daily morning calls, ad-hoc discussions)
- Clear time horizons (strategist specifies "3-month view" vs "tactical")
- Transparency about conviction and risk (strategist communicates uncertainty)
- Two-way feedback (traders share market intelligence, strategists incorporate)

=== MiFID II Impact on Strategy Research

*Background:*
MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II), effective January 2018 in Europe, unbundled research from execution services. While Australian firms aren't directly subject to MiFID II, many have global clients affected by it.

*Implications for Strategists:*
- Increased pressure to demonstrate tangible value from research
- More formalized client feedback and research consumption tracking
- Some firms charge explicitly for strategy research (vs bundled with execution)
- Greater focus on actionable recommendations and measurable performance
- Enhanced documentation of client usage and research impact

*Response Strategies:*
- Track record maintenance (documenting performance of calls)
- Client surveys (measuring satisfaction and research usage)
- Customization (tailored research for specific client needs)
- Multi-channel delivery (written, video, in-person to maximize engagement)
- Integration with trading (clear links between research and execution)

=== Compensation Structures (Australian Strategy Roles)

*Junior Strategist / Strategy Associate*: AU\$80,000 - AU\$120,000 base + AU\$20,000-40,000 bonus

*Strategist (3-6 years)*: AU\$120,000 - AU\$180,000 base + AU\$40,000-80,000 bonus

*Senior Strategist (6-10 years)*: AU\$160,000 - AU\$250,000 base + AU\$60,000-150,000 bonus

*Head of Strategy (10+ years)*: AU\$220,000 - AU\$400,000+ base + AU\$100,000-350,000+ bonus

*Chief Strategist / Chief Economist*: AU\$300,000 - AU\$600,000+ base + AU\$200,000-800,000+ bonus (plus potential equity/long-term incentives)

_Note: Compensation varies significantly by firm size, research impact, and client revenue generated. Top strategists at major global banks with strong client following can earn significantly more. Hedge funds and buy-side roles often pay 30-50% premium for strategists with proven track records._

== Conclusion

Strategist roles in Sales & Trading offer intellectually stimulating careers for those passionate about macroeconomics, markets, and translating complex analysis into actionable insights. The Australian market provides excellent opportunities to cover unique dynamics - commodity-driven currency, close China linkages, significant interest rate market, and sophisticated institutional client base.

Success as a strategist requires combining analytical excellence with exceptional communication skills. The best strategists don't just forecast correctly - they explain their views compellingly, defend their calls under scrutiny, acknowledge when wrong, and maintain credibility through market cycles. Key attributes include:

*Analytical:*
- Deep macroeconomic knowledge and forecasting ability
- Understanding of cross-asset relationships and market dynamics
- Quantitative modeling and data analysis skills
- Ability to synthesize large amounts of information quickly

*Communication:*
- Clear, compelling writing that drives client action
- Confident presentation and media skills
- Ability to simplify complex topics without oversimplifying
- Active listening and tailoring messages to audience

*Personal:*
- Intellectual humility (acknowledging uncertainty and risks to calls)
- Resilience (handling criticism when calls wrong, maintaining conviction when right but early)
- Curiosity (constantly learning about new markets, policies, relationships)
- Integrity (being honest about track record, not cherry-picking successful calls)

The career path typically progresses: Junior Strategist → Strategist → Senior Strategist → Head of Strategy → Chief Strategist/Economist, with opportunities to branch into:
- Buy-side (hedge funds, asset managers, super funds)
- Policy/economics (central banks, treasury, consulting)
- Portfolio management (leveraging macro insights in investment decisions)
- Media/commentary (full-time financial journalism or thought leadership)

Compensation can be attractive, particularly for strategists who build strong client followings and demonstrate consistent value-add through research. Track record matters enormously - strategists are ultimately judged on whether their calls make clients money and generate trading flow.

The role has evolved with MiFID II research unbundling creating pressure to demonstrate tangible value, increased importance of multi-channel communication (written, video, social media), and growing emphasis on quantitative rigor and data science skills. Modern strategists need broader skillsets including programming (Python/R), data visualization, and understanding of systematic investing strategies.

For students considering strategy careers, building strong foundations in economics, finance, and data analysis is essential. Internships at banks or economics consulting firms provide valuable experience. Developing communication skills - writing clearly, presenting confidently, engaging on social media - differentiates successful strategists. Most importantly, cultivate genuine intellectual curiosity about how economies and markets work.

The Australian strategy landscape offers unique opportunities: covering AUD as a commodity currency with China exposure provides interesting analytical challenges; the sophisticated institutional client base (large super funds, asset managers) demands high-quality research; and the time zone position allows Australian strategists to bridge Asian and global markets. For those passionate about macroeconomics and markets, with strong analytical and communication skills, strategy roles provide a fulfilling career path at the intersection of research, client advisory, and market impact.
