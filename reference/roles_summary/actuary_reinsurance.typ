# Actuary at Reinsurance Companies

## Overview
Actuaries at reinsurance firms are the mathematical backbone, pricing complex risk transfers, modeling catastrophic events, managing capital, and ensuring financial stability across aggregated portfolios and tail risks.

## Core Responsibilities
- Analyze cedant data and conduct mortality, morbidity, or claims frequency/severity studies on reinsured portfolios to assess experience and inform pricing assumptions for treaty renewals
- Lead treaty pricing analysis from data receipt through final proposal, evaluating risk quality, building actuarial models, and negotiating rates with primary insurers and brokers
- Establish IBNR reserves and assess case reserve adequacy using chain ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, and frequency-severity methods for quarterly financial reporting and IFRS 17 compliance
- Run catastrophe models (RMS, AIR, CoreLogic) to estimate probable maximum losses, assess accumulation exposures, and calibrate models for portfolio-specific characteristics and climate trends
- Monitor actual versus expected experience on in-force treaties, conduct profitability analysis, identify adverse development trends, and recommend retention or restructuring strategies
- Support capital adequacy assessments under APRA standards, stress testing, internal capital modeling, and Board-level reporting on enterprise risk management and financial condition

## Key Skills Required

### Technical Expertise
- Advanced catastrophe modeling platforms (RMS, AIR, CoreLogic) and statistical modeling techniques
- Actuarial software proficiency (R, Python, SAS, Prophet) and reinsurance structures knowledge
- IFRS 17 accounting standards, APRA Prudential Standards, and Solvency II framework understanding
- Loss reserving methodologies and capital modeling for regulatory compliance

### Analytical & Strategic Thinking
- Risk assessment across geographies, perils, and accumulation scenarios with limited historical data
- Assumption setting balancing technical precision with commercial judgment and uncertainty
- Portfolio optimization connecting actuarial analysis to business strategy and profitability
- Climate change integration into forward-looking catastrophe and pricing models

### Leadership & Communication
- Presentation skills for Board, clients, regulators, and cross-functional stakeholders
- Negotiation abilities for treaty pricing and terms with cedants and brokers
- Team leadership, mentoring junior actuaries, and developing technical talent
- Professional skepticism defending methodologies while supporting business objectives

## Work Mode

### Analytical Modeling (50-60%)
Deep work building pricing models, running catastrophe simulations, analyzing cedant exposure data, conducting loss reserving analyses, performing sensitivity testing, updating experience studies with emerging claims data, and validating model outputs.

### Client & Stakeholder Engagement (20-25%)
Presenting pricing proposals and reserve results to cedants, underwriters, CFOs, and Board committees; participating in treaty negotiations; addressing technical questions; building relationships; attending industry conferences and regulatory meetings.

### Documentation & Reporting (15-20%)
Preparing pricing memos, assumption papers, reserve methodology documentation, regulatory submissions (APRA), IFRS 17 calculations, audit responses, Board presentations, and quarterly financial reporting supporting business decisions and compliance.

### Team Collaboration & Development (10-15%)
Reviewing junior actuaries' work, mentoring on technical analyses and exam preparation, coordinating with underwriting/claims/risk teams, contributing to methodology development, participating in hiring, and engaging in professional learning and Institute activities.

### Research & Innovation (5-10%)
Investigating emerging risks (climate, cyber, pandemic), researching new modeling techniques, back-testing models against actual catastrophe events, developing proprietary models for under-modeled perils, attending technical seminars, and contributing to industry thought leadership.

## Workplace Culture
Intellectually rigorous environment balancing technical precision with commercial pragmatism; collaborative cross-functional teams; global exposure through multinational reinsurers; exam-supportive with study time.
