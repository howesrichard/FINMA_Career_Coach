# Quantitative Researcher (Hedge Fund)

## Overview
Quantitative researchers develop systematic investment strategies using mathematical models, statistical analysis, and machine learning to identify market inefficiencies and generate returns through data-driven approaches.

## Core Responsibilities
- Discover predictive signals and return factors through statistical analysis of market data to generate alpha for systematic trading strategies
- Design systematic trading strategies with robust risk-adjusted returns using mathematical models and rigorous empirical testing methods
- Process and analyze massive datasets including market data, fundamentals, and alternative data sources to identify tradeable patterns
- Simulate strategy performance on historical data with transaction cost models to validate robustness and profitability before live trading
- Apply machine learning techniques such as regularized regression, ensemble methods, and neural networks to improve return predictions
- Translate research findings into production-quality code for live trading systems working closely with technology and trading teams

## Key Skills Required

### Technical & Quantitative
- Advanced degree (PhD/Masters) in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Computer Science, or Engineering
- Expert programming in Python (pandas/numpy/scikit-learn), R, and C++ for performance optimization
- Deep statistical and econometric knowledge including regression, time series, and machine learning methods
- Database skills (SQL) and ability to efficiently process and analyze large-scale datasets

### Research & Analytical
- Understanding of financial markets, instruments, trading microstructure, and transaction costs
- Machine learning expertise including regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble methods
- Optimization and numerical methods for portfolio construction and risk management

### Interpersonal & Professional
- Intellectual curiosity and creativity in problem-solving with rigorous scientific mindset
- Resilience to handle research failure as most ideas don't generate tradeable alpha
- Clear communication of complex technical concepts to diverse stakeholders including PMs and investors

## Work Mode

### Research & Analysis (70-80%)
Conducting statistical modeling, backtesting strategies, machine learning experimentation, coding data analysis pipelines, literature review, and generating alpha signal ideas through rigorous empirical testing

### Meetings & Collaboration (10-15%)
Participating in team research reviews, brainstorming sessions with colleagues, PM strategy discussions on portfolio construction, and technology integration meetings for production implementation

### Presentations (5-10%)
Presenting research findings to team members and senior leadership, explaining complex methodologies and results, contributing to research committees and strategy reviews

### Documentation (5-10%)
Writing detailed research reports, documenting code and analytical processes, maintaining research databases and version control systems for reproducibility and knowledge sharing

### Production Monitoring (0-15%, increases with seniority)
Senior researchers spend additional time monitoring live strategy performance, diagnosing production issues, and proposing enhancements based on real-world trading results

## Workplace Culture
Intellectually rigorous environment emphasizing empirical validation and performance measurement. Collaborative teams (5-50+ researchers) value meritocracy and scientific skepticism.

## Career Path
- Entry: Junior Quantitative Researcher (0-3 years post-PhD/Masters)
- Progression: Senior Quantitative Researcher (3-7 years) → Portfolio Manager/Head of Quantitative Research (7-15+ years) → CIO or launch own fund
