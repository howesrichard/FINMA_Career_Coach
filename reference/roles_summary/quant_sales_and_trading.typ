# Quantitative Analyst (Quant) in Sales and Trading

## Overview
Quantitative Analysts develop mathematical models, pricing systems, and risk analytics for derivatives trading at global and local banks. This role bridges mathematics, computer science, and finance to build models for complex derivatives and trading tools.

## Core Responsibilities
- Implement and code pricing models for derivatives into production systems, testing against market data and validating accuracy across various market conditions and scenarios
- Calibrate model parameters to market prices including volatility surfaces, yield curves, and other market observables to ensure models reflect current trading conditions
- Design and build robust production systems for pricing exotic derivatives and calculating risk metrics, ensuring high performance and reliability for trading desk operations
- Research cutting-edge quantitative methods from academic literature and implement innovative approaches to solve complex pricing and risk management problems
- Collaborate with traders to troubleshoot pricing issues, support complex derivative valuations, and develop customized analytical tools for specific trading strategies
- Ensure models meet regulatory requirements including CVA calculations, capital requirements, and model risk management frameworks while maintaining comprehensive documentation

## Key Skills Required

### Technical Expertise
- Strong mathematical foundation in stochastic calculus, PDEs, and numerical methods for derivatives pricing
- Advanced programming proficiency in C++ for performance and Python for rapid prototyping and analysis
- Deep understanding of derivatives pricing theory including Black-Scholes and term structure models
- Expertise in numerical methods: Monte Carlo simulation, finite difference, and tree-based approaches
- Knowledge of machine learning techniques for calibration and hedging optimization

### Interpersonal Capabilities
- Ability to translate complex mathematical concepts into clear explanations for traders and stakeholders
- Collaborative problem-solving approach with attention to detail and rigorous testing methodology
- Leadership and mentoring skills for guiding junior quants and managing team dynamics
- Strong communication skills for defending model choices and managing stakeholder expectations

### Regulatory Knowledge
- Understanding of model risk management frameworks including validation and governance requirements
- Familiarity with capital regulations including CVA, VaR calculations, and FRTB requirements
- Knowledge of APRA prudential standards and regulatory examination processes for model oversight

## Work Mode

### Model Development & Implementation (50-65%)
Building pricing models and risk systems through coding, testing, debugging, calibrating parameters to market data, performance optimization, and production system deployment with robust error handling.

### Research & Innovation (15-25%)
Reading academic papers on derivatives pricing, investigating new methodologies from quantitative finance literature, prototyping novel approaches, and evaluating cutting-edge techniques for potential implementation.

### Collaboration & Support (15-20%)
Working with traders on complex pricing issues, coordinating with technology teams on system integration, partnering with risk management on model validation, and supporting new product development initiatives.

### Documentation & Communication (5-10%)
Writing technical specifications and model documentation, creating user guides for traders, presenting to risk committees and senior management, and responding to regulatory inquiries about model methodologies.

### Strategic Leadership (Senior roles: 30-40%)
Setting research priorities and development roadmap, managing team of 3-8 quants, making architectural decisions for model frameworks, resource allocation, and building collaborative team culture.

## Workplace Culture
Intellectually rigorous environment balancing academic theory with practical trading constraints. Collaborative code review culture with competitive high-performers, typically 8:30am-6:30pm hours.

## Career Path
