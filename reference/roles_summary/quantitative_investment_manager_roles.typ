- Clean, process, and analyse large datasets from market data, fundamentals, and alternative sources to extract actionable investment signals
- Build and test predictive models for stock returns, risk, or trading signals using advanced quantitative and machine learning techniques
- Simulate strategy performance on historical data through rigorous backtesting to validate research ideas before implementation
- Write production-quality code in Python, R, C++, or MATLAB for research and trading systems, maintaining high software engineering standards
- Stay current with academic finance research and industry developments, contributing to knowledge base through literature review and publications
