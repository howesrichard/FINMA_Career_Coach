# Trader Roles in Sales and Trading

## Overview
Traders in institutional bank S&T divisions make markets, manage risk, and execute client orders across asset classes using sophisticated algorithms and human judgment. Modern trading combines electronic execution, automated market-making, and discretionary positioning within regulatory frameworks.

## Core Responsibilities
- Execute client orders using optimal execution algorithms (VWAP, TWAP, Implementation Shortfall) while minimizing market impact and achieving best execution across multiple venues
- Manage electronic market-making strategies by monitoring automated quoting engines, adjusting spreads based on volatility, inventory positions, and competitive dynamics
- Monitor and optimize algorithmic trading performance through Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA), comparing execution quality against benchmarks and documenting best execution
- Maintain risk positions within limits by tracking P&L, exposures, and hedges across manual and algorithmic trading activity, responding quickly to market movements and limit breaches
- Price complex products and provide competitive two-way quotes to clients via voice and electronic channels while managing bid-offer spreads and adverse selection risk
- Collaborate with sales, quants, and technology teams on client solutions, algo development, market color, execution strategy, and electronic trading infrastructure optimization

### Client & Sales Collaboration (10-15%)
Working with sales on execution strategies for complex client orders, explaining algo performance and market dynamics, providing market color and insights, presenting TCA reports demonstrating execution quality, discussing hedging approaches.

### Risk Management & Reporting (5-10%)
